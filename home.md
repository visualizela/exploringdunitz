title: Exploring Los Angeles through the Robin Dunitz Mural Archive
---
This project explores Los Angeles neighborhoods through the Robin Dunitz Mural collection. Students from Professor Dana Milstein's Fall 2018 Writing 150 Sustainability course first explored the Robin Dunitz Collection at AFA Library as well as online through USC's Digital Library. These collections served as a starting off point for thinking about Los Angeles, the environment, and ways to understand various issues and challenges that face different neighborhoods, from gentrification to hostile archicture to community organizing. Students then identified a neighborhood which they visited, documented, and wrote about through the lens of sustainability, exploring the relationship between murals and the neighborhoods in which they exist.
