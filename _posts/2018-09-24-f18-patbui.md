---
Growing up in a white neighborhood, I never realized how white-washed and uncultured my childhood was until I moved to the diverse melting pot known as Los Angeles. Most of my friends were Caucasian, leading me to never diversify my cultural pallet. I was amazed when I moved to college and found that Little Tokyo, African American communities, the remains of Little Italy, and Koreatown were all within 10 miles of each other. Nothing compared to the culture shock I felt when I first visited Koreatown. Little tiny shops in every corner with the doors opened. Neon lights that’s screamed to people to come in posted in every possible section. Densely populated areas surrounded by people who always looked like they were having a good time. Korean characters printed everywhere. Amazing food spots that opened way past midnight for everyone to enjoy. A community of people who seemed to have a connection just because they live in the same 2.7-mile radius of this small town. Dumbfounded and unable to discern that I was still in America because of the bizarre contrast juxtaposed to my hometown. Koreatown will always have a special place in my heart has it has given me a taste of how it feels like to live in another culture. It would be a shame if in a couple of decades Koreatown would no longer exist and would be replaced by plain typical skyscrapers that tower all over Los Angeles. This is a sad realistic reality that will happen if gentrification in Koreatown continues to occur. The urban metropolitan city of Los Angeles pressures gentrification upon smaller neighborhood such as Koreatown attributed by unsustainable living expenses, financial contingency plans, and an influx of other ethnic groups entering the city. Koreatown’s rich history along with its people is what makes it a cultural phenomenon. No other place in America will quite feel like Koreatown Los Angeles and this is why it is so important to preserve its culture and identity. The future of this town is unclear as there are many investors trying to urbanize it just for profit. People from all different ethnic backgrounds are coming to Koreatown because of its perceived cheap rent. (Lee, 2018). Awareness of this problem needs to be spread if this town is going to survive for future generations to enjoy.

Before Koreatown was known as tourist attraction for its many bars and casual 24/7 dining, it had a long history spanning back to the 1800s. The immigration of Koreans started in 1882 with the United States-Korea Treaty. This ended isolation with Koreans and allowed them to immigrate to North America. Los Angeles quickly became a main port for Korean immigrants continuing today where it is home to the largest Korean community in America. In 1965 Congress passed the Immigration Act which abolished the quota system that restricted the number of Asian immigrants allowed to come into America. (Chong, 2017).  Large waves of Korean immigrants began to immigrate into America. These immigrants laid the foundation of the cultural hub known as Koreatown. As more Koreans started to come to Los Angeles, they began to build churches, restaurants, businesses, and stores. They formed a community where incoming immigrants could come and feel right at home. It was a place where Koreans would not be judge for not knowing how to speak English and could assimilate to American culture at their own pace. They brought their traditional style and culture, shaping Koreatown’s architectural designs and neighborhoods. Its district covers around a five hundred-block area of Los Angeles's mid-Wilshire, Central and Hollywood districts. (Census Reporter, 2018).  Koreatown became a place where other Americans could tour to get a taste of what Korea is like. 

A common misconception about Koreatown is that it only consists of Koreans, but this is far from the truth. In reality, only a third of its population is Asian. The majority population consist of Latinos, who make up half of the town. Latinos are an integral part of the culture as they have learned to cope and get along with Asians. Koreatown is routinely an initial destination for Latinos and Korean immigrants. Immigrants use it as a transitional neighborhood where they can make their first adjustment to their new lives in America. This contributes to why there is such a high percentage of illiterates in Koreatown.  According to the U.S. Census, the city’s density is 42,611 people per square mile which is among one of the highest densities for the entire county. Koreatown has a rich history of being a slum. Even today, the median household income is around $30,558 which is one of the lowest in the country.  A correlation of household income can be found when looking at the average education level within the town. By looking at the graph made my LA times, it shows that a majority of the population does not have a high school diploma, which makes it difficult for these people to find high paying jobs. With the widespread knowledge of Koreatown’s low average household income, it makes it even more egregious that companies are coming to build expensive apartment complexes. 
   
If you have not visited Koreatown within the past couple of months you will be very surprised at how quickly it is starting to change. With the ongoing construction of new buildings, entire blocks of streets can quickly become unrecognizable. (Chiland, 2018). Within the 2.7-mile radius of Koreatown there is more than 52 ongoing projects. Each project is destroying old Koreatown buildings which is what gave Koreatown its identity. These new exquisite buildings are an example of the gentrification going on in Koreatown. 

As a couple of group members and I visited Koreatown, we stumbled upon a native of Koreatown as our Uber driver. His named was Justin and he explained to us how growing up in Koreatown was a blessing. He was an immigrant from South Korea and came here at a very young age. He explained how he felt very comfortable and “at home” when he first saw Koreatown. Our group asked him about how he felt about the future of Koreatown and this was where his emotions appeared dejected. Justin responded saying “I am very sad about all the new buildings materializing in Koreatown because in order to make these new buildings they have to tear down old Koreatown buildings or restaurants.” (Justin, 2018).  In place of the traditional restaurants, is newly renovated apartments or commercial real estate that people living in Koreatown cannot afford. People are slowly getting forced to leave their homes and with that, K-Town’s culture and sense of community diminishes. Justin expressed to us how much Koreatown meant to him. It is his childhood and the place where he grew up. Even now when he has the adequate wage to move out the slums of Koreatown, he has chosen to stay because he loves the traditional food, people, and sense of community.

Koreatown’s gentrification can be attributed to Los Angeles’ metropolitan neighborhoods with its extremely high cost of living. An infiltration of non-Koreans looking for sustainable cheap rent is making Koreatown a hot commodity. Investors see this as opportunity to make a fortune, so they buy and tear down Koreatown land marks without thinking about what that landmark means to the community. Looking through RentCafe, the average price of a 1-unit apartment in Koreatown is around $1618 compared to Los Angele’s average price of $2265. K-Town’s competitive prices with its many tourist destinations makes it one of the hottest and up-and-coming neighborhoods. From the perspective of the natives living in K-Town, this is not necessarily a good situation. Not only are they losing their community due to an influx of other ethnic backgrounds infiltrating their town, but they are also being bought out and kicked out of the homes they grew up. They cannot afford to stay due to rent increases and high prices of lavish apartment complexes. To them, they are losing their town and there is nothing they can do about it. A very similar situation happened when USC bought the surrounding neighborhood homes and restaurants in order to excavate and build the village. Many minorities lost their homes or business and there was nothing they could do to stop it. A clear example of this can be seen with data from New York Times.  USC’s undergraduate tuition which is above 53,000 is more than double the median household income in the City Council district that is home to the campus which is around $26,300. (New York Times, 2017). Citizens from that community could not afford to stay there and were forced to move out. The same situation is happening with Koreatown just on a bigger scale.

In just a few short years, the secret has spread, and millennials have chosen Koreatown’s rents and city amenities over their more expensive counterparts. (Lee, 2018). If people look at Koreatown five years ago, they can see that commercial department stores did not exist. There was only local mom and pop shops with every restaurant being owned by locals. Now, commercial giants such as Target are coming in and taking business away from local shops. Naturally, people are going to go to Target because it is globalized, and people know what to expect from it. These monopolistic types of moves will kill most small businesses and run Korean people out of town. With residential zones quickly turning into commercial zones, the state or Koreatown is in jeopardy due to gentrification. (Chiland, 2018).  Large developments are not meant to benefit neighborhoods, rather the investors who pour millions in hopes of making a profit. Landlords next to commercial zones will start to increase rent giving many natives no choice but to move out. Gentrification defined as, “the process of repairing and rebuilding homes and businesses in a deteriorating area accompanied by an influx of middle-class or affluent people and that often results in the displacement of earlier, usually poorer residents.” (Merriam-Webster, 2018) is a major problem that most people are not taking seriously. If not prevented, gentrification will end the era of Koreatown Los Angeles for the hundreds of thousands of Koreans living there. Change is quickly coming in the form of cranes and metal jackhammers. 

Another clear sign that Koreatown is getting run over by gentrification is the destruction of its murals. Before Koreatown became such a prosperous attraction there was significantly more murals around the city. According to Chiland (2018), around 30% of Koreatown’s murals have been removed within the past 5 years.  As my group toured Koreatown, our main goal was to check out numerous murals within the town. We located the murals from a GitHub post but to our surprise, around half of the murals on the post were torn down and replaced by expensive housing complexes. The only murals we are able to find were the ones located underground in the metro station.All of the murals above ground were destroyed because investors
valued money over the cultural importance of these murals showing our group that gentrification is a real problem in Koreatown. 

These underground murals did not evoke the same sense of intimacy with its citizens as they are blocked off with a fenced platform. It took away the user interaction with the mural and was there just as eye candy. The destruction of the murals can be seen a symbol of what is going on with the culture of Koreatown. The murals are a representation of Koreatown’s culture and as they are getting destroyed, so is Koreatown’s identity. With the demolition of all of town’s history and landmarks, Koreatown will soon look like a typical suburb of Los Angeles with nothing to differentiate it from the rest of mundane cites.

There is still hope for preserving cultural hubs such as Koreatown. With the fear of gentrification taking the city over and making it a bland suburb of Los Angeles, people are starting to realize this is a major issue. Americans do not want every city to look the same as we are considered to be a “Melting Pot”. With the city of Los Angeles pressuring gentrification upon neighborhood such as Koreatown, awareness needs to spread in order to prevent the end of K-Town. People need to realize that unsustainable living expenses, financial contingency plans, and influxes of other ethnic groups is killing a cultural phenomenon. No other place in America will quite feel like Koreatown Los Angeles and this is why it is so important to preserve its culture and identify. The future of this town is unclear as there are many investors trying to urbanize it just for profit. Awareness of this problem needs to be spread if this town is going to survive for future generations to enjoy. Not only is this a problem in Koreatown LA but this is a major problem every suburb in America is facing. Gentrification is big problem and the sad reality is that most American citizens do not know it is going on.
