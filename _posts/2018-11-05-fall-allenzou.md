Venice – An Evolving Community

Piercing through the clouds, beams of sunlight illuminated the streets of Venice. Cafes were buzzing, and Venice was waking. When questioned about Venice’s culture, a barista responded, “The last fifteen to twenty years we were overrun by gangs and now it has cleaned up a bit. For the most part, it is gentrifying.” Though it was founded as a resort town, Venice, due to decades of neglect, deteriorated to such a state as to be dubbed the “Slum by the Sea.” However, with the recent influx of large corporations and startups, and their efforts of putting money into Venice, it has become one of the most expensive neighborhoods in Los Angeles in terms of property value. Their presence creates a domino effect, which can be reflected in the people, presence of authority, and art culture of Venice. As a byproduct of new businesses, especially in the technology sector, a young and educated workforce has come to inhabit the community. A result of this is a gentrified community, which is oftentimes masked by the large population of tourists. Additionally, these rapid changes have brought forth a stark divide in socioeconomic status that is echoed across Venice’s divided residential areas and juxtaposing presence of authority. To expedite gentrification, the administration has implemented hostile architecture. Art on the other hand, remains a medium for individuals to express themselves and communicate the neighborhoods Bohemian culture. This idea is further supported through the accessibility to Venice’s plethora of art. Anyone can walk up to a mural, and not only observe it from different perspectives, but also directly engage with it. Yet, the placement of art does not always promote inclusivity. Oftentimes, it is found plastered on fences and concrete walls, which are used to separate a specific elite from the remainder of Venice.

Historically, Venice was founded by Abbot Kinney – a millionaire tobacco tycoon. In addition, the area was once a lucrative oil field. In spite of this, it lacked the momentum to become a sustainable community. Kinney’s implementation of the amusement pier and canals generated immense popularity, which left Venice’s public services unable to keep up with the community’s growing demand. Unfortunately, the oil craze was also short lived. From a holistic viewpoint, the discovery of oil deteriorated the neighborhood; it left Venice’s waterways clogged with waste and in destitute. Now with the presence of technology companies such as Snap Inc. and Google LLC, the prospect of sustainability is called back into question. From 2012 to 2014 Pardee Properties – the highest selling real estate broker in Silicon Beach – experienced “20 percent gains each year” almost entirely due to “the tech sector” (Goldbloom, 2014). This indicates the neighborhood’s growing wealth, alongside its increasing number of highly educated residents. The reason behind this educational growth stems from the presence of companies like Google INC, which have reputations of only hiring from the nation’s top prospects. This entails Ivy League graduates or graduates of institutions of a similar tier. Moreover, the median age for Venice’s residents is thirty-five, and almost two thirds of residents are between nineteen and forty-nine years old.

This highlights the neighborhood’s abundant population of millennials, who apart for their young age, are likely to carry progressive views. Adding this to Venice’s already notoriously Bohemian lifestyle thus manifests conditions conducive of a dynamic and lively community.

Many of these millennials, however, do not come to Venice as agents of diversity; rather, they come as agents of gentrification. This is a result of the superficial allures of working in Venice: warm weather, six-figure salaries, entertainment, etc. ¬With property value that has risen approximately “246%” in the past fifteen years, Venice has become a place where “millennials are flocking for high-paying jobs and easy commutes” (Kusisto, 2017). The social prestige and professional development associated with working at companies such as Vice Media and Buzzfeed, Inc. are unparalleled; the high salary and extensive network creates an additional incentive for ambitious engineers and entrepreneurs. An influx of a highly educated, wealthy, and young population is the byproduct of this. Likewise, this promotes the opening of fine dining, luxury housing, and designer boutiques. The gentrification is not merely visible in socioeconomical terms, but also demographical. Over half of Venice’s residents are white. In the words of childhood resident, there are “almost no black residents” and “Glencrest Barbecue ¬– one of the old black-owned businesses – ¬has been replaced by an artisanal barbecue joint” (Ho, 2016). The large congregation of whites – who are amongst the most privileged racial groups in the United States – reveals the outcome of gentrification. There becomes a lack of racial and ethnic diversity. An underlying factor for this racial homogeny can also be attributed to the inability for many refugees and immigrants to afford the neighborhood’s high living standards.

Nevertheless, Venice remains prominent in the tourism sector. In large, this is due to its beaches, but it is also a result of Abbot Kinney Boulevard being dubbed the “Coolest Block in America” by GQ Magazine – an internationally acclaimed men’s magazine dedicated to fashion, style, and culture (Sample, 2012). Instinctively then, tourist in and around Los Angeles, which in itself is already one of the world’s most popular destinations, feel inclined to visit Venice. This has the properties of hiding the full extent of the neighborhood’s gentrification. With an estimated “10 million visitors in 2015,” and within that number, the majority being aged between “25 and 34,” Venice lives up to its title as the “second largest tourist attraction in Southern California.”  The sheer volume, alongside age similarity of the community’s tourists makes differentiating tourists from locals almost impossible. Moreover, approximately “62% of tourists have an average income over $50,000” (“Explore Venice,” 2017).  This reflects socioeconomic diversity within the tourists, thereby giving the perception that Venice too has a great deal of income diversity. This is further stressed in that tourist come not only from all across the United States, but also from all across the world. In day to day life, geographic diversity is oftentimes correlated with ethnic diversity, which creates the facade that Venice homes various ethnic groups. This thus masks the scope of homogeneousness and gentrification in Venice. 

Despite tourism’s best efforts, the presence of an affluent group cannot be concealed. The wealthy reside in the hearth of Venice, and this should come as no surprise. After all, Venice was founded on the bases of being a luxury get away town. However, following Kinney’s death, the town fell into turmoil and property value dropped. This allowed Venice to foster a poor, yet richly diverse group. And while the money flowing into Venice from the presence of technology companies has once more revitalized its affluent vibe, it still maintains “one of the highest homeless populations of the city [Los Angeles]” at “approximately 15%” (Halpine, 2004). This exhibits that gentrification does not occur overnight; Gentrification’s effects are long lasting and rippling. Venice’s geographic divisions illustrates these rippling ramifications; the wealthy live in one area and the poor live in another. This physical division lends itself to a mental divide within the community. A prime example is residents’ stance on whether or not companies such as Snap Inc. should remain. Generally, those at or below the middle class cannot keep up with the financial burdens associated with large technology companies, and thus want nothing more than for tech companies to leave. Meanwhile, the wealthy view the presence of these companies as a type of insurance. Large companies and startups not only provide quick access to high end products and services, but also inflate property value. The wealthy own property, making them more inclined to view higher property values and increased living standards to be profitable investments. The socioeconomic divide also creates barriers; Snap Inc. utilizes guards outside their offices. By doing so, Snap Inc. generates an elitist aura around itself and its employees. This generates a stigma that the wealthy are selfish – only being concerned about their own wellbeing.

The presence of authority in Venice has also experienced radical changes as a result of gentrification. During Venice’s decades of neglect following its annexation to Los Angeles, it gained a reputation for gang violence. A local story has it that an actress walking home one night was stopped by a “cop refusing to let her through” because down the street, “people” were being shot (Olen, 2014). Though most gang activity has left the community in the past couple decades, police presence has increased, particularly in poverty-stricken areas such as Oakwood. Venice Beach Boardwalk too has experienced an increased police presence. Arguably, it is the most centralized location for Venice’s homeless population. Gentrification is reflected here as the wealthy have taken initiatives to separate themselves from the neighborhood’s violence and crime. This entails residing in areas with high property value, erecting physical barriers, and implementing state of the art security systems. The role of the government is also reflected in their treatment of the homeless. As Eric Ares – a communications coordinator for the Los Angeles Community Action network – put it in response to news of a police’s killing of a homeless man, “police brutality and the criminalization of the homeless can’t be separated.” Ares then goes on to state that Venice, along with Skid Row, are the “two most police saturated areas of the city [Los Angeles] as a result of being locations “where homeless folks butt up against wealthy folks” (Lewis, 2015). This illustrates the complications burgeoning from socioeconomic tensions. The community’s growing demand for gentrification is conducive to an environment where affirmative measures are taken; authority figures feel added pressures to maintain safety for the elite. As a result, this leaves them more susceptible to making spontaneous and oftentimes questionable decisions.     

Another measure the community has implemented is hostile architecture. 

![You change this and put in your own Image title](images/hostile benchjpg.jpg) 
   {:.image}

Around the city, public spaces are being designed to restrict people from using them for reasons outside of their intended use. For example, benches throughout Venice are designed with designated personal space. Though this appears as an added luxury, its main function is to prevent the homeless from sleeping on benches. This allows Venice to regulate its homeless population without directly evicting homeless camps, arresting individuals, etc. By not offering a place to sleep, Venice makes itself a less appealing community for the homeless to reside. Another prominent form of hostile architecture is the neighborhood’s abundance of fenced schools. Even right off Abbot Kinney Boulevard – Venice’s most gentrified street – schools add a layer between themselves and the surrounding area. Such can be seen at Westminster Elementary School, as it does not allow tourist or locals to utilize its parking lot, playground, etc. 

![You change this and put in your own Image title](images/zouschool.jpg) 
   {:.image}

All of Westminster’s facilitates are intended to be utilized on the premise of maximizing its students’ education. While this goes to showcase hostile architecture’s attempt to increase living conditions, it still forms an atmosphere of negativity. It shows that school administration is weary of residents, and thus take precautionary measures against them. 

Likewise, art in Venice is plastered everywhere; it is out for people to interact with. This has always been the case for the community. It has always had a reputation for having a Bohemian culture and being a hub for creativity. In 1970, Venice in the Snow – a nineteen by seventy-foot mural – was erected due to Los Angeles being a place where “beautiful things are allowed to happen suddenly.” The ease of getting such a large mural commissioned demonstrates Venice’s open attitude towards change. This dynamic culture is additionally represented in the neighborhood’s continuously changing street art. In some instances, in order to keep up with the latest trends, Venice also happens to be an area where “suddenly, a beautiful thing can be thoughtlessly destroyed” (Wilson, 2018). This captures Venice’s abundance and accessibility to art, but also its limited space. Public art takes various forms and utilizes practically everything as a medium. Taking Main Street for example, a mural by an artist known by @felipaintress on Instagram illustrates a complex design covering the side view of a liquor store.

![You change this and put in your own Image title](images/zouliquor.jpg) 
   {:.image}
   
Not only is the mural located in a highly accessible area, but also a well-traveled area. Anybody can touch it; anybody modify it. The art is for the public, which @felipaintress demonstrates through inculcating the names of various Venice residents who donated throughout the body of the mural. 

As aforementioned, Venice’s art has no set medium. It has even gone so far as to be the subject matter of residential fences, steps, and sidewalks. By having art practically everywhere, the neighborhood is able to showcase its untraditional culture, and its acceptance towards utilizing untraditional mediums to convey the interpersonal messages of artists. As depicted on the exterior of a local bar, Art Mortimer’s “Brandelli’s Brig,” captures a bar owner and his wife in “a mural inside a mural inside a mural” (“Mural Conservancy of Los Angeles,” 2018). This reflects Venice’s open attitude towards uncustomary art subjects, as well as its ability to keep up with contemporary art movements. Moreover, “Brandelli’s Brig” is not only located on the side of a bar, but also on Abbot Kinney Boulevard, reflecting the nondiscriminatory geographic boundaries of Venice. Apart from “Brandelli’s Brig,” murals can also be widely seen scattered on the surfaces of fences. 

![You change this and put in your own Image title](images/FenchBarrier.JPG) 
   {:.image}
Frequently, these fences are used to enclose residential areas from the greater Venice community. This reflects the impact technology companies have on Venice. Wealthy millennials who are not prepared to face the poverty clinging onto Venice use physical barriers to ignore such inequities. By allowing artist to create aesthetically apealling work on an otherwise dull barrier, the wealthy are able to further cover up the drastic divide within the neighborhood. 

Since its establishment as the “Venice of America” in 1905, Venice has widely been accepted as a richly untraditional and dynamic neighborhood. Abbot Kinney bought the land and transformed it into a utopic hotspot. He dug canals modeled after Venice, Italy. He built the amusement pier to entertain residents and passersby. Therefore, it should have been no surprise when technology companies decided to infiltrate the community, and sometimes even designate it as their home base as with Snap Inc. Venice is unique; Venice is accepting of creativity –a key component of technological innovation. With such a large and powerful industry entering Venice, however, there are bound to be a multitude of consequences directly correlated with this newfound presence. Particularly for Venice, these are highlighted in changes in Venice’s residents, jurisdiction, and artwork. Regardless, at the end of the day, Venice is an evolving community. While it is gentrifying as a result of the corporate world, the future of Venice remains unknown. The future of Venice remains a mystery, a mystery which can only be revealed by time itself.
