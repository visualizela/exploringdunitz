The origin of the expression “go with the flow” is unknown. Some scholars believe it was derived from William Shakespeare’s play Julius Caesar while others say the idiom originated from second century Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus’ writings. Either way, the phrase still emcompasses the theme that change is relentless, and it is impossible to always cling on to the past. While the “go with the flow” mindset is ideal for a carefree life, the expression is difficult to follow when the world around you is rapidly changing. Downtown Los Angeles (DTLA) developers have made recent efforts to rebrand and shape downtown into the proud center hub of Los Angeles. An evaluation of the demographic changes, restoration of murals, and various development projects in downtown Los Angeles illuminates how the area -- through the process of gentrification -- is attempting to transform itself into a strong centered urban city of the future. The population of white middle class workers is increasing and changing the ethnic and economic demographics, and Skid Row and the rest of downtown have been negatively affected by the gentrification efforts. The city strives to preserve past murals that represent the cultures and ideas of Los Angeles through the restoration of Victor Clothing Co. building and freeway murals; yet recently made murals are selfie-oriented and cater to the incoming millennials. From analyzing housing prices, advertisements, and hostile architecture, Los Angeles is trying to portray the image of being a city for the future with little regard for the previous inhabitants. 
Los Angeles is notorious for being an extremely diverse community with many ethnic enclaves ranging from Little Tokyo to Olvera Street. However, despite housing a significant amount of Asians, whites, Hispanics, and African Americans, the ethnic makeup of downtown Los Angeles has evolved within the short time span of five years. Since 2010, “there has been a 36% increase in the white population and a corresponding 17% and 18% decrease in the Black and Hispanic populations, respectively.

Fig. 1. This graph illustrates the population changes in Downtown LA from 2010 to 2015 (“Demographic” 1). 
   {:.caption} 

This comes as Downtown L.A.’s overall population has increased by over 9,000 people - almost 30% - in the same time period” ("Demographic" 1). As the population in Downtown LA increases, the diversity decreases. The inverse relation suggests how the development of the modern city attracts eager white people while displacing the current ethnic population. Not only did Los Angeles change racially, but the city also saw an increase in household incomes: “In the 2010 reporting period, the median household income was $22,338 - less than half of the county average. By the 2015 reporting period, median incomes rose to $38,182 - a 70% increase” ("Demographic" 1). This statistic does not insinuate that the original DTLA population is overall receiving more money; rather, the median change is a result of new residents, who are mostly white middle class individuals, making downtown their home. While the city is becoming urbanized, the native residents are not part of the movement. Downtown Los Angeles is facing a large increase in white and financially stable citizens, which in turn pushes out the black and Hispanic communities that originally resided there. The demographics in Downtown Los Angeles also reveal changes upon Skid Row, DTLA’s sectionalized area of homelessness and poverty. 

Due to the widespread gentrification in DTLA, there have been recent endeavors to deconcentrate homelessness and poverty in the mainly black populated Skid Row. Skid Row, infamous for an immense amount of homelessness, is a 54 block area in Downtown Los Angeles that developed during the late 1800s in order to cater the transient workers, aimless rail workers, and other low-income citizens. In 1975 the Redevelopment Plan passed with the intention to concentrate rehabilitation and social services to the homeless population in one part of the city. The Redevelopment Plan, “which aimed to stabilize the provision of low‐income housing, particularly [single room occupancy] hotels and social services in the Skid Row area represented a compromise between Downtown investors and some public officials who sought to increase land values by displacing the homeless population away from Downtown redevelopment projects” (Reese 315). At the time, this plan helped both corporations and the homeless. The homeless would not interfere with the corporate work space and potential investment projects, and in return, would gain more access to shelter space and services. However, investors in the 21st century have found financial incentives to invest and develop Skid Row, which is now adjacent to the newly urbanized areas of downtown. Redevelopers’ plans “ officially unleashed in 1999… with the passage of the Adaptive Reuse bylaw, which permitted the conversion of vacant commercial structures into residential buildings. (Reese 317). Now that investors want to develop Skid Row, the homeless population is not the city’s priority. Officials want to further develop downtown into a thriving center. By depopulating Skid Row through the act of gentrification, poverty-ridden people are being displaced with fewer places to go. 

The efforts of deconcentrating homelessness and poverty in Skid Row due to the appeal of monetary gain creates a dichotomy between the new and old residents of DTLA. There is a stark difference within the population residing in downtown that can be observed throughout the streets of downtown LA. The gap between downtown’s center and the homeless population continues to become smaller as gentrification spreads. Abandoned plots of land that used to be home for some are being converted into buildings or public spaces. Figure 2 illustrates a row of tents housing a few victims of homelessness along a plot of trash littered land with a sign stating

“good things are coming.” The land will be developed into a park which ultimately means that the homeless people living on the block will need to move. With the wire fence, there is a clear separation between the hopes of developers increasing land value and the people becoming negatively affected by the gentrification. Subtle hints in the landscape of DTLA reveal how the city cannot accommodate the original homeless population with the rush of young white middle class citizens coming into Los Angeles. 

Not only can the changes in Downtown Los Angeles be seen through demographics, but they can also be noticed through murals. The Victor Clothing Co. building has been a downtown staple for years, housing four massive murals along its walls that tell the city’s Mexican heritage. The owners of the building, Salcedo and Harter, not only sold suits, but they also were art lovers. Hiring only Latin artists to support their local Spanish speaking community and customers, the 
two wanted to put their walls to use and commissioned multiple murals: The Bride and Groom (1972), El Nuevo Fuego (1985), Nino y Caballo (1984), and The Pope of Broadway (1985). However, in the late 90s, the local business was

forced to shut down as profits sharply declined and foot traffic become non-existent. The building finally sold to Clinton Financial Corp. in 2001, and dozens of residents who lived in the lofts received a 30-day eviction notice. One five-year resident and artist Neal Taylor stated, “‘I think it is an inevitable way things shift in cities.' Taylor and a number of other residents said that they expect to move away from Downtown to find affordable lofts” (Maese 1). As a result of the new developments, most of the original residents cannot afford the new rent prices rising in downtown and are being pushed out. Although the people cannot stay, the murals and building continue to be a cultural landmark. Clinton Financial Corp, the building’s new owner, “intends to restore the facade to its original 1920 status, turn the building into loft living/work spaces and add some restaurants on the bottom floor” (Victor 1). Even though the preceding renters are unable to afford and live in the new building, the developers wanted to preserve the murals that were painted to represent the previous mostly Hispanic community. The culture of the original residents is preserved, but the same people have no choice but to leave as gentrification continues. 

In the past, the government has set aside generous sums of money in order to preserve murals and the message and culture they represent. In the 90s and early 2000s, graffiti artists in Los Angeles began painting over murals. Some of the victims were the 51 freeway murals located in the Los Angeles County. Most of these murals were commissioned before the 1984 Olympics and range from depictions of kids playing sports to marathon runners to cars in traffic; the murals tell the story of Los Angeles, yet were destroyed by graffiti. In order to reverse the vandalism of the freeway murals, the state paid “1.7 million to restore 27 of Los Angeles County’s 51 ravaged artworks” in 2001 (Martin 1) . The government tried to preserve the superficial look of the city, including the many murals that portray different Los Angeles cultures and ideals. While some critics, who wanted to see the restoration of all 51 murals, might say 1.7 million was too little, the amount given was actually quite generous considering how much California’s money is usually dedicated to the arts. In the same year, the California Arts Council’s budget was $1 million (United States i). The restoration project for the Los Angeles County freeway murals had a budget that was almost twice the size of the California Art Council’s budget, which is used to help art organizations, fund art programs, and promote awareness for the arts. In comparison, the government reserved a large sum of money for the freeway murals with the intention to maintain the facade of diversity and culture in the ever-increasing gentrified downtown LA. 
As Los Angeles strived to keep old murals with the intention to preserve its past, new street art is trying to cater to millennials. Downtown Los Angeles in the 2000s had to catch up to strong centered urban cities, like New York and San Francisco, that were already filled with trendy coffee shops, Kombucha bars, and hot yoga studios. These cities were desirable to the new generation; Downtown Los Angeles wanted that same desirability. In order to compete, “regions must make the quality-of-place and the amenities of the new economy central elements of their strategies to attract knowledge workers and build high-technology economies” (Florida 47-48). Los Angeles city planners needed to find a way to attract the people of the future by elevating the “quality-of-place;” art is often used as a strategic variable that can lure people and the firms that come along. Art can encourage “‘high’ culture tourism effects and also [can] create the edgy street scene that is so attractive to young knowledge workers” (Currid 369). In order to attract these highly coveted workers, Downtown Los Angeles transformed itself into a mural covered city. It is almost impossible to walk through downtown without seeing Instagram worthy murals with bright and vibrant colors. Now that many recent murals are made to be aesthetically pleasing to the incoming millennials' social media accounts, they do not have the same focus on preserving and resembling different cultures of downtown. Los Angeles has shifted its focus from presenting artwork that displays the community to becoming a city with murals of angel wings that are perfect for a picture-worthy post. 

Los Angeles is currently experiencing a development boom that is redefining the whole city. To put it in perspective, DTLA has not undergone the current level of development and construction in almost a century. With a multitude of new luxury apartments and condos being built, the city is accommodating to the population increase in downtown. However, these new housing developments are not meant for the average Los Angeleno; rental costs have seen a significant increase in the past years that many native residents cannot continue to afford. Currently, the median rent for an apartment “in Los Angeles is $2,483 - one of the highest in the country… Since 1970, the percentage of severely rent-burdened residents, people who spend more than 30% of income on rent living, in the lowest 20% of the income distribution increased from 53.6% to 77.8%” (Goulding 1). Since many households have to spend a large proportion of their income on rent, people struggle with budgeting monthly expenses such as childcare, utilities, food, transportation, and healthcare. In many cases, families, who called Downtown LA their home before the influx of people and trendy restaurants, have to relocate and find cheaper housing further from the heart of Los Angeles. Often times, these families are Hispanic or African American and in a lower income bracket than the people currently moving into the city. However, developers disregard the fact that housing is becoming more unaffordable, and the city does little to provide rent control. Researchers “estimate that Los Angeles needs to produce roughly 5,300 affordable housing units per year to keep up with the demand. The city has averaged only 1,100 units per year since 2006. According to the Los Angeles Times, approximately 20,000 rent-controlled units have been taken off the market since 2001” (Goulding 1). The need for affordable living arrangements through new developments and preservation of existing apartments is a major concern for Angelenos, yet building owners increasingly terminate affordable housing agreements and make rent-controlled housing unavailable. As a result, low-income Angelenos find themselves unable to keep up with the rising market prices and are either displaced to the outskirts of Los Angeles or left homeless. 

Advertisements sprawled across the city picture luxury products, suggesting downtown LA houses and wants to continue to host young and wealthy big spenders. In order to cater to young and higher income residents and tourists, DTLA has and plans to provide deluxe housing and entertainment. The Park Hyatt, one of the highest tier hotels in the Hyatt brand, is known for symbolizing

luxury and exceptional service. This type of hotel is perfect for leisure or business travelers who want a emphasis on sophistication and elegance; it is also one of the types of people Downtown LA wants to attract. In addition, there is a poster advertising “LA’s Tallest Condominium Address” with a photo of a futuristic building. Lofts and condominiums already located in the area have mostly one or two bedrooms and bathrooms that appeal to single person inhabitants or young families; there is no room for old or large families in the heart of downtown. In order to appeal to the people of the future, LA has to appear to be a modern city full of young innovative minds. There are large advertisements featuring Lebron James listening to Beats headphones and the new iPhone XS. Capitalizing on the younger generation’s love of sports and technology; these ads indicate that LA’s demographic is increasingly becoming younger. The various entertainment and housing advertisements are meant for the working millennial generation and not the still prevalent homeless population in Downtown Los Angeles. 

City planners try to deter unwanted population groups, such as the homeless, with hostile architecture. Hostile architecture often goes unnoticed, but for those who do not have a place to sleep at night it is a clear sign that they are not welcome in the community. One major form can be seen through infrastructure such as benches: 

![You change this and put in your own Image title](images/Liang_hostile.jpg)
   {:.image}
Fig. 5. In the pictures above, there are various examples of hostile architecture in the form of public benches.
   {:.caption} 

This type of design is meant to make it uncomfortable or impossible to sleep on. The dividers on the benches, while they may look like armrests to some, are in place so no one can lie down. Hostile architecture has a “negative impact on most people’s well-being, that it is particularly bad for the worst-off, and that overall it has no positive effects” (de Fine Licht 31). There are detrimental psychological effects on the homeless population when they know that the city wants nothing to do with them. Instead of addressing and helping the problem of homelessness, Los Angeles would rather cast these people aside and make their sleeping situation harder. In terms of the rest of the population, there is little aesthetic or practical benefit from making the urban environment hostile. Overall, hostile architecture promotes isolation and is a way to keep the homeless further from sight. 

Due to gentrification efforts, the ethnic and economic demographics have become more white middle class heavy which has negatively affected Skid Row and created a stark dichotomy between old and new Los Angelenos. The city wants to maintain the facade of being culturally diverse by restoring the Victor Clothing Co building and freeway murals, yet it recently covered  the walls of LA with aesthetic murals that cater to millennials’ social media accounts. The combination of expensive housing, luxury advertisements, and hostile architecture demonstrate how Los Angeles is welcoming young middle class workers and casting aside the homeless and lower income residents. From looking at the demographic changes, mural restorations, and construction projects in DTLA, it is clear that the gentrification of downtown Los Angeles intends to convert the city into a strong centered urban center of innovation. As the city quickly changes, the original people residing in the area have to adapt. While “going with the flow” is the ideal mindset for the situation, not everyone has the luxury or the money to continue their lives in the heart of Los Angeles.
