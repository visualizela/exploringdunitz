More than 50 people were killed and thousands were left injured in the L.A. Riots of 1992 (Medina, 2017). Houses and businesses were set on fire. A white truck driver was pulled out of his truck and his head was stomped into the ground. In the late 1990s, South Los Angeles was a difficult place for African Americans to live. Although the reasons have changed, South L.A. has remained an area where African Americans and other low-income groups struggle to reside. Since the late 1900s, University Park and the surrounding area has seen a decrease in diversity in the population due to racism and gentrification, which is shown through the artwork and signage in the community. University Park has long been a breeding ground of discrimination and bias. Faced with this escalating reality, African Americans have been forced to leave the community. Feelings of racism have decreased in recent years, but the gentrification of the neighborhood is continuing to drive out low-income families because they can no longer afford to live in the place they call home. Many of these changes can be seen in the signage and artwork throughout the community, which represent the majority Latino population that currently resides in University Park. 

Low-income populations have been struggling to live in University Park since the late 1900s. Racism, discrimination, and riots were a major contributor to the exodus of the African American population in the 1990s, while the gentrification of the neighborhood plagues low-income families that currently live in the area. In 1992, a mostly-white jury acquitted four white police officers of the videotaped brutal beating of an African American motorist who was pulled over for speeding. Almost immediately after the decision, riots broke out in South Los Angeles. The residents were furious and beat a white truck driver who tried to pass through the area. A state of emergency was declared by the mayor and the governor ordered the national guard to intervene because the riots were so intense (Mydans, 1992). Acquitting the white police officers was the last straw for many African American residents in the area. Upon witnessing such blatant racism and experiencing harsh police brutality, South Central L.A. saw an emigration of African Americans. The aftermath of the riots was apparent for many years and is still a source of tension between the African American community and the police in South Los Angeles (Medina, 2017). 

Gentrification caused by the University of Southern California has also been a source of tension that has driven locals out of the community for many years. The abundance of students desiring upscale living has made University Park a hot spot for realtors and developers. In an article posted in the Los Angeles Times, developer David Pourbaba states that a neighborhood near USC is "one of the best we have left" (Khuori, 2016). He does not mean to imply that its current state is desirable, but rather that potential for development offers huge profit. Properties in the neighborhood can be bought at very low cost, renovated and upgraded, then sold for approximately three times the value they were purchased at. However, in an area where the median family income is around $30,000, buying a house that costs $800,000 is simply unattainable. Instead, the houses are purchased by USC faculty, staff, and companies that rent out bedrooms to students for thousands of dollars per month. This forces previous tenants to leave the neighborhood as the white and wealthy move in, increasing racial tension in the area (Khuori, 2016). As people of higher socioeconomic status migrate to the community, the resources available also shift to cater the more affluent residents. 

The development of the USC Village is an ongoing addition to the gentrification of the USC neighborhood. The USC Village is 15 acres composed of student housing and retail. In order to build The Village, neighborhood business were shut down with the promise that local residents would be able to shop and eat at the new restaurants and stores. However, the two city council districts in South Los Angeles are the poorest in the city (Herstik, 2017). It is unlikely that someone would be able to buy a meal from any restaurant in The Village for less than $10-15, making the restaurants economically inaccessible to the local community. The grocery stores in The Village, Trader Joe's and Target, are also the most expensive in the area, resulting in The Village being rarely utilized by the community. These types of stores lessen their resources and price them out of their own neighborhood. 

The lifestyle and accessibility differences between USC students and the surrounding community were portrayed in the mural *Lifeline: Creating a Healthy Community.* Painted in 1993 and located in Exposition Park, the mural was meant to portray the desires of the community. It contained images of children reading, receiving proper healthcare, and riding bikes. All of these things are standards of living amongst the students at USC, but are hard for local residents to attain. The biggest image on the mural was a set of hands filled with nutritious foods. Studies have shown that "neighborhoods with a higher proportion of African American residents have fewer supermarkets and fewer high-quality food options" (Lewis, 2005). Eating healthy foods can prevent obesity, disease, and illness. If many basic necessities, such nutritious foods and other necessities portrayed in the mural, are inaccessible in a community, residents may be forced to move in order to attain access these goods and services.

An additional aspect of the mural was the diversity it represented, portraying families and children of many different ethnicities. However, the mural was destroyed in 1998, soon after a noticeable shift from diversity occurred. Another prominent mural in University Park is *Mercado la Paloma.* Painted about ten years ago and still present in the community, the mural depicts an almost entirely Latino population. Similarly, many small murals and pieces of street art can be found scattered throughout the neighborhood depicting Latino figures and traditions, such as the mural of Carlos Santana that is painted on a bakery on Vermont avenue (Recinos, 2011). The increase in Latino artwork and decrease in murals portraying more than one ethnicity reveals the loss of diversity in University Park.

*Mercado la Paloma* also displays the optimism of the Latino population in their new neighborhood. Meant to replicate the inside of the building, the mural contains images of families eating, smiling, painting, and shopping. Mixed in amongst all of the shoppers stands a smiling woman holding a book titled *Living Wage.* This woman represents the hopes of the Latino community as they settle in the University Park and South Central neighborhoods, desiring a shift from earning minimum wage to making enough money to provide a sustainable lifestyle for themselves and their families. As African Americans were driven out of their community, the Latino community found their home.

   The Latino identity can easily be seen when walking through University Park. Mexican bakeries are abundant, many of the restaurants serve Mexican food, and Spanish signage can be seen on most buildings and signs. In some places, it is hard to find even a bit of English signage. Most of these restaurants and businesses are local and family-owned, displaying the strong community they are a part of.  However, when new restaurant and retail chains open their doors to cater to wealthy USC students, local families are left with no income. At an event hosted by Los Fotos Project, 17-year-old Marisabel Perez discussed the effects of USC on her community, posing the question, "If you're displaced from a low-income community, where do you go after that?" (Sequeira, 2017). University Park is one of the most over-crowded neighborhoods in the country. Although its population is majority Latino, it is not because they can afford to live there, but rather they have nowhere else to go. In 2015-16, South Central Los Angeles saw a 44% increase in homelessness (Woocher, 2017). The gentrification caused by USC and developers is leaving the low-income community with nowhere else to live. 	

The University of Southern California has been a reason for increased housing prices, inaccessible groceries, and the closure of many local businesses, all contributing to the loss of diversity in the surrounding neighborhoods. Many low-income residents have been forced to leave their communities due to unaffordable living, while countless people have also felt exiled because of racism and discrimination. In the 1990s, the neighborhood displayed artwork of diverse populations trying to better their community. This artwork has been replaced by murals and signage portraying the largely Latino population that currently resides in University Park and the South Los Angeles area. As USC continues to develop and racism persists, the University Park neighborhood continues to decrease in diversity. Although it has been 25 years since the L.A. Riots, African Americans continue to emigrate from the neighborhood in which they took place.
