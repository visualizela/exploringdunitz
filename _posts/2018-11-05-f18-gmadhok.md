When I was 6 years old and first learned what a tent was, I burst through our front door after school full of excitement and asked my mom if we could live in a tent. She replied, “No sweetheart, tents are only for camping.” A few weeks ago, I was surprised to see rows of tents lining the street next to a brand-new Target and state-of-the-art apartment complex under construction. These contemporary buildings replaced the far less appealing apartments of citizens who could no longer afford them and now live in the tents. Down the street, during lunch time, individuals of all races and varying socio-economic class flock to the neighborhood’s traditional marketplace for its dynamic mix of cuisines and vendors. However, many of the previous residents of the region cannot purchase the items being sold now. This neighborhood in Los Angeles, University Park, is just one town of many in America that is the victim of gentrification. Gentrification, through the developments transpiring in the region, shapes the diverse group of hard-working individuals populating University Park by altering the landscape of the neighborhood and triggering detrimental psychological, health, and academic effects on the inhabitants. This practice dismisses less fortunate dwellers of an area and replaces them with traditionally more well-off groups, observed by monitoring the changing demographics. 

Gentrification ensues due to the ability of real estate investors to purchase cheap land in these regions, construct there, and generate high returns. This craving to build in these areas encourages redevelopment and propels the cost of living higher than an amount manageable for low-income households, perpetuating this cycle. The system uproots households, facilitates displacement, and augments the homeless population. Moreover, the addition of more upscale businesses shifts the landscape of the neighborhood. As the features of the area change, locals desire a response from city leaders. Additionally, groups pushed out from their homes must relinquish community support systems, leading to a high mental health cost. Furthermore, moving to an unfamiliar place demands individuals uncover different systems of preserving well-being, provoking unfavorable health consequences. Finally, switching schools prevents students from receiving a consistent education and subjects them to higher risk of dropping out.    

Gentrification is a process that alters the demographics and landscapes of regions such as University Park. The Encyclopedia of Environmental Change defines it as when “traditional inner-city” neighborhoods are replaced with new and improved housing, higher-end market services, and wealthier inhabitants. The process takes time, but the shifts in the residents of the district illustrate its effects. According to Woocher (2017), the African American population in Los Angeles has fallen in a few decades from 13% of the total population to 8%. Along with this, Woocher also indicated that 13,000 Latinos were displaced in the Hollywood region between 2000 and 2010 due to upscale redevelopment driving up rent. Because the demographics of the county change as certain groups of people are forced to move out, the data demonstrates the real phenomenon of gentrification in Los Angeles. Over time, a cycle launches as renovations continue to happen and push up rent even further, uprooting groups of people who cannot afford to pay the increasing cost of living, modifying the landscapes of localities such as University Park. Census data for the region shows that “92.2% of the occupied housing units are rented and only 7.8% are owned.” Because only 7.8% of the tenants own housing units, the majority of them face the consequences of the changes to rent. Overall, in the University Park neighborhood, gentrification takes the form of improved housing and services, increasing rent, and more affluent inhabitants.

In localities such as University Park, the cheaply available real estate resells for a higher price. When the construction of new, more extravagant homes begins in a “traditionally inner-city” area, it commences a cycle of gentrification in the region. These more expensive homes drive up the cost of living, displacing lower-income groups and bringing in more well-off ones. When wealthier people migrate into an area, the market services become more upscale, sparking the desire for other affluent individuals to move there, changing the demographics of the region completely. This is common in Los Angeles. Woocher (2017) revealed that “Los Angeles was recently voted the number-one site for real estate investment in North America.” Because of Los Angeles’ status as a lucrative site for real estate investment, the cheaper places to find zones to build in tend to be in lower-income communities. Developer David Pourbaba stated that South Los Angeles is “one of the best neighborhoods left” to invest in because land is available for “around $80 a square foot, compared with $500 a square foot downtown” (Khouri, 2016). The massive difference in cost per square foot between South Los Angeles and downtown indicates exactly why real estate investors value land in low-income districts. Because the land is cheaper, better and more improved buildings can be constructed for cheaper. Since many groups build at the same time, the market spaces around these modern buildings revamp to become more upscale, creating greater desire for more well-off citizens to purchase these current homes and apartments and live in that neighborhood. 
 
While the real estate is initially cheap to purchase, as redevelopment happens in a region, the cost of living increases. The rise in the cost of living pushes out those who can no longer afford to live there and replaces them with more affluent individuals. In a report cited by Velez, “A high poverty rate, unemployment and underemployment in the community made it a challenge for some members to afford housing” (Velez, 2015). In South Los Angeles, all these factors combine to make it extremely difficult to pay for a place to live. Because of the high poverty rate and the high unemployment, occupants of South Los Angeles struggle to find work to pay for the skyrocketing costs of living. South Central Los Angeles is “the most over-crowded neighborhood in the country… and 8-in-10 residents are renters” (Woocher, 2017). Woocher goes on to explain that around 70% of the tenants that rent “spend more than 30% of their income on shelter.” The imbalance between income and cost of living, especially for shelter, puts individuals in a tough situation where they must decide whether they can spend that amount of money on shelter. The high poverty rate coupled with the ever-increasing cost of living contributes to the cycle of gentrification and forces out lower-income citizens who cannot afford housing, replacing them with more wealthy inhabitants.

When lower-income tenants are displaced in a community, homelessness in the region surges. The pictures taken from the fieldwork in University Park illustrate the homeless population occupying tents on the sidewalks. According to Woocher, real estate investors reap “hefty profits” while leaving the poorer tenants displaced or homeless. If the occupants are uprooted, they can either remain in the area homeless or try to find somewhere to live “far away from their jobs, families, and communities” (Woocher, 2017). Furthermore, a report published by Human Impact Partners estimates that “4,445 renters within a ½ mile of The Reef development face a high or very-high risk of displacement” (Avey, Harris, Alexander, & Santiago, 2015). The data from the report indicates that the construction taking place leaves thousands of locals at risk of displacement, showing how upscale renovations contribute to homelessness. Poorer residents in these localities encounter this situation and must make a decision on whether to keep their jobs and become homeless or try to start a new life in a different community. Additionally, Woocher (2017) stated that from 2015 to 2016, South Central experienced “a 44% increase in homelessness.” The large leap demonstrates the consequences of gentrification and shows how it completely alters the landscape of districts through perpetuating movement and homelessness.

In addition to the escalations in the homeless population showing the effects, the shops and services available in an area shift when gentrification occurs. An example of this is a 30-story tower that would bring “1,218 homes and up to 300,000 square feet of office, retail and restaurant space” to a lower-income region, completely transforming the landscape (Khouri, 2016). For this reason, some community members started a lawsuit against the company executing the project. In these districts, contractors bring in massive projects such as the 30-story tower to increase the desire of affluent individuals to move to that area, illustrating how gentrification not only impacts the demographics, but also the shops and spaces that exist for residents. After conducting the fieldwork of University Park, one location stood out. Mercado la Paloma, a food court and market, shows the changing landscape. Within the Mercado, there are quick service restaurants with diverse cuisines from Ethiopian to Thai to Mexican. A meal at Azla Ethiopian could cost between $7.50 and $11.95, while plates at Chichén Itza ranged from $10.99 to $14.99, catering to the varying socio-economic status of those who enter the Mercado. However, the majority of people eating at these restaurants were either professionals wearing suits or USC students, all appearing to be middle-class, showing that the restaurants in the Mercado no longer cater to the poorer locals of the area. Additionally, the shops in the Mercado sold ethnic clothing as well as USC apparel, showing how the proximity to USC influences the products sold.

When gentrification occurs in a region, the goods and services available in the markets revamp to become more upscale to cater to the wealthier inhabitants coming to the area, shifting the entire community landscape.
When a society undergoes this process, citizens often go to city leaders for a response to the effects. One way in which the mayor of Los Angeles responded was to try and address the homelessness crisis. Wampler (2016) stated that Eric Garcetti proposed to increase spending on homelessness from $18 million to $138 million in the 2016-2017 budget. The drastic boost in funding to combat homelessness was his response to the crisis. As the landscape of Los Angeles continues to vary, residents look to city leaders, such as the mayor, to take action to improve the lives of those affected. Although the mayor has tried to take action, many locals feel neglected as their voices and needs remain ignored. UNIDAD member Ishmail Marcus Allgood stated: "We're not against development in the city. What we're against is the displacement of the working class, the middle class...we want to be included in the development and planning of the city” (Anderson, 2017). Allgood’s words show that members of communities experiencing unrequested, harmful renovations want to be part of the conversation that makes decisions about upgrades in the city. Because inhabitants want better resources and markets for themselves, they become frustrated when improvements only occur due to the migration of more well-off individuals. The desire of residents for a conversation with city leaders illustrates that they want a say in the changing landscapes of their communities.

In addition to creating frustration for locals, gentrification disturbs the mental health of a region. Because it often leads to displacement, the movement of members of a community affects those uprooted as well as those remaining. Cohen found that “Long-time neighborhood residents commonly develop deep social ties and strong social support networks within the community. When the neighborhood and social connections therein are broken up, this ‘social loss’ creates excess stress and psychological effects” (Cohen, 2014). Cohen presents a topic of importance, the mental health of an area undergoing gentrification. Being part of and feeling a sense of home within a community provides “many social and health benefits.” When a person is part of a group for many years and then pushed out, it takes a large mental toll on the person as they lose not only their home, but also their support system. Additionally, Tran found that “gentrification imposes a mental health cost on longtime residents and the most financially vulnerable residents” (Tran, 2018). Tran’s research demonstrates that the people who are the least financially stable and have lived in a region the longest bear a large mental health cost. The cost arises because they are the most connected to their community after having lived there for so long, and they are also the most likely to face eviction as they are not financially stable. This combination may require these citizens to leave their home and try to build a new life somewhere else, causing potential mental health issues. These studies illustrate displacement’s significant mental health ramifications, particularly for the most financially vulnerable populations.

Along with the mental health repercussions, there are also many adverse health outcomes. Because gentrification drives the movement of populations, it can influence the access to healthy food choices, transportation, exercise facilities, and schools for those populations. In a report produced by the Association of Bay Area Governments, “Vulnerable populations typically have shorter life expectancy; higher cancer rates; more birth defects; greater infant mortality; and higher incidence of asthma, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease” (Cravens, Chion, Reilly, Adams, & Kurella, 2009). Forced migration as a result of gentrification causes these terrible health consequences. When individuals leave their communities, they must find different places to go for their healthcare, to buy their food, to exercise, etc. Not having access to all these parts of a healthy life leads to all the negative health effects described above. Macias and Morales discovered that “The high cost of health care prevented almost 60 percent of participants from seeking care, even when it was felt necessary” (Macias and Morales, 2000). The results of the study showed that health care has an extraordinarily high cost, and the cost itself impeded the majority of the participants from seeking the health care that they needed. When gentrification occurs in a community, the high cost of living is a main factor in figuring out who relocates. For those already in that vulnerable position who cannot afford shelter, adding on the cost of healthcare is extremely unrealistic and leads to all these adverse health issues.

Gentrification not only has unfavorable mental and health repercussions, but also negative outcomes on the education of those impacted. Students who are victims of forced movement face exceptionally terrible consequences on their education. They have to move schools and learn how to navigate an unfamiliar school again. The census data from University Park illustrates that only 5 out of the 34 schools listed in the area have a rank of 8 out of 10 and above. The data shows that students at these schools are not receiving an adequate education in the first place, and displacement will only make that situation worse. According to Gasper, DeLuca, and Estacion in 2012, “Students who change schools are more likely to drop out,” indicating that when students switch schools, their education is negatively affected as they face a higher likelihood of dropping out. Moreover, the study took into account other factors on students who move often, such as more school absences, a non-intact family, lower incomes, etc. The study found that even after taking into account these risk factors and comparing students who had these factors and moved schools to students who had these factors but did not move, there was still an “increased dropout by between 6% and 9%” for students that changed schools. The results of this study demonstrate that moving schools has a direct relationship with dropping out of school. Students who switch schools experience a more difficult time adjusting to the new school and being successful within it. Because of this, gentrification has a clear influence on the education of students involved. If they are uprooted and forced to attend a different school, the students will experience negative effects on their education.

In conclusion, gentrification replaces traditional inner-city neighborhoods with upscale services, improved homes and more affluent inhabitants. Real estate developers desire to build in these areas because the land is cheap and allows them to make a profit. When the region is being revamped, the cost of living, specifically rent, rises. This process leads to displacement and enlarges the homeless population. Furthermore, it alters the way a region looks and what goods and services it offers. The changing landscape of the community coerces residents to try and speak with city leaders to prompt adjustments. Movement and separation from community leaves families and individuals with mental health struggles. In addition to mental health problems, it also causes health issues as these citizens must figure out how to maintain their health in unfamiliar communities. Finally, it leads to an augmented rate in dropping out for students because they have to move schools and adjust to new learning environments. In University Park, gentrification transforms the landscape of the community and increases the likelihood of negative mental, health and education effects on the diligent and dynamic group of citizens populating the neighborhood. Optimistically, developments in the future will take place so that the current inhabitants of the region experience the benefits of the renovations and are not relegated to tents on the side of the street. I hope that my mom’s words will one day represent a reality where tents are only used for camping, not living.
