Los Angeles (LA), the second largest city in the United States, embraces the influx of culturally dynamic demographics. Studying and living in the University of Southern California (USC) for more than a year, I usually meet Justin in the dining halls. He often describes himself as a Taiwanese-American indulging in researching cutting-edge biomedical technology and aspiring to become a doctor in Japan. Sometimes, I receive homework help for Chinese classes from Stuart, whose mother is Chinese and father is American, and he would like to learn both languages and cultures. Sometimes, I ask help of programming assignments from Alexandra during office hours, and she is from Eastern Europe and interests in exploring the potentials of artificial intelligence. They represent different racial background, different gender representations, and different social status, and they come from different parts of the world to receive higher education and prepare themselves with skills necessary for the future employment. However, educational and career opportunities are not open to everyone living in this city. A lot of people are deprived of employment and educational support due to racial prejudice, gender inequality, or socioeconomic disadvantages. Regarding racial background, African Americans, Hispanics, and Latinos, often receive unfair treatment, such as reduction in salary and basic welfare, as the idea of racial inequality hinders racial minorities from developing interpersonal relationships to become competent enough in higher-paying jobs. Moreover, gender also largely influences decision-making in employment and education. For example, a woman working and living in LA is less likely to get promotion and receive equal employment opportunities than the male counterpart. With the addition of social prejudice, specific industries, such as management and administration, have overwhelmingly limited women roles. Finally, class structure plays a pivotal part in deciding a person’s quality of life, and that largely depends on a person’s living location and working space in the city. If you reside and work in a compact region, you are probably characterized as “lower-class”. Thus, demographic factors, including race, gender, and class, directly influence a student’s career and educational opportunities, shaping the differences between the USC community and the general LA area.

Racial and cultural diversity is characteristic of LA. However, people of different ethnic background tend to receive different treatment in terms of their employment and educational opportunities. From past to present, race is a critical part of America’s history and culture. However, the divide between different racial communities has always existed. Under the modern context, it is presented in the discrepancy of opportunities between different racial groups: white and Asians are favored with a great number of career and education, but African Americans and Hispanics suffer significantly from the dearth of job offerings. The table below (Figure 1) ranks the opportunities of occupations by race and nativity.

**Figure 1**: Opportunity Ranking of Occupations by Race/Ethnicity and Nativity, All Workers. From this figure, Latinos has the highest low-opportunity and middle-opportunity and the lowest occupations, while white has the lowest high-opportunity and the highest middle-opportunity and low-opportunity occupations. Reasons include differences in education levels and racial discrimination.
   {:.caption} 

From the column graph, white has the highest high-opportunity (58%) occupations, while Latino has the highest middle-opportunity (45%) occupations. The comparison between these two numbers points out that whites have a far greater chance of landing in a much more well-paid job than Latinos, but it also indicates that around half of the white population earns $10,000 annual salary, which is more than half of the Latino population in the LA county. Also, Latino immigrants (13%), U.S.-born Latinos (33%), and blacks (36%) have the least access to high-opportunity jobs. One of the reasons associated with differences in their access to career opportunities is racial discrimination. This issue has been raging since the foundation of this very country. Year after year, activists gather together and fight against the bias in order to eliminate such behaviors in the future.

**Figure 2**: Dependent Variables and Neighborhood Characteristics by Latent Class, White, Mexican and Central American Adults, in which different racial group correspond to different entropy scores in the table. The higher entropy scores indicate more frequent discrimination. From the figure (especially in Latino section), U.S. born & advantaged and U.S. born, young & jobless Latinos are more likely to be discriminated than non-Latino whites.
   {:.caption} 

Even though the voice for racial equality is undying, “the association between ethnoracial diversity and everyday discrimination is positive” (Landale, 2017). Specifically, the table (Figure 2) utilizes statistical approaches to record discriminatory experiences in Latino, White, Mexican, and Central Americans adults. From the table, U.S. born & advantaged Latinos (2.64, 0.43, 0.23) are more likely to experience discrimination than U.S.-born whites (0.43, 0.26, 0.10). U.S. born, young & jobless Latinos encounter the most instances of perceived everyday discrimination (2.69), major experience of discrimination (0.44), and discrimination experience with police (0.23). Therefore, the statistics also indicate that discrimination and a lack of career development are positively correlated. As a matter of fact, discrimination limits one’s ability to succeed in his or her career and prevents minority groups from building networks with management and administrative levels, cutting off opportunities for promotions and fair pay. What’s worse, racial discrimination causes dissent and has even led to strikes, which have occurred on our university campus. In USC, the nonwhite workforce, including “black or brown, with the vast majority being Latino” is primarily employed for elementary food-related and cleaning-related services (Houston, 2016). Due to “the university’s unfair labor practices” which at one time, included “deploying the notion of ‘community’” as a term that served to suppress differences under a rhetoric of ‘common goals’”, HERE Local 11 service workers once organized a strike, The USC You Never See, consisting of marching bands in Pershing Square, and “decided to engage in fast” in 1998 (Houston, 2016). Aspiring to integrate into the surrounding Exposition Park community, USC has modified terms and policies to satisfy the demands of local workers and safeguard equality in terms of job opportunities and benefits.  

While USC has made efforts to address issues regarding racial discrimination, it still faces significant challenges in terms of gender equality. USC recently experienced lawsuits and controversies about Dr. George Tyndall’s sexual harassment, and gender equality has become a controversial topic on the campus. One of the reasons behind sexual harassment is imbalance of social powers and social authority, and this imbalance is often reflected in differences in career and education opportunities for different genders. Looking at LA as a whole, sexual harassment in workplaces are still unacceptably common and male-to-female ratios in certain sectors, such as technology and engineering, are heavily male oriented.

**Figure 3**: The Distribution of Occupations Among the Female Workforce (Since 2000). From the figure, women ‘s involvement in most of the occupations stay relatively constant or even decrease from 2000 to 2012. However, the trend shown in the statistics does not align with the recent development in facilitating women’s career success. Reasons include negative stereotypes and “stereotype threats”.
   {:.caption} 
   
For example, the above table (Figure 3) outlines the distribution of occupations in a variety of social fields among the female workforce since 2000. Women’s distribution in different industrial sectors stays unchanged and even decreases. From 2000 to 2012, previously dominant women’s occupations, such as arts, design, entertainment (5%), healthcare support (3%), and legal (2%) stay constant, and others, including education, training, library (8% to 7%), production, transportation and material moving (10% to 7%), and natural resources, construction, and installations (0.7% to 0.6%), have less female involvement. Women’s participation in some of traditionally gender-biased and higher-paying careers such as STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) and architecture, is “only 2.5%, compared with 6% of men in LA” remaining “the same in 2012 as it was in 2000” (Mount Saint Mary’s University, 2012). The lack of growth in women’s involvement in STEM-related fields can largely be attributed to negative stereotypes, including cliched beliefs such as “girls are not as good as boys in math and science” and “scientific work is better suited for boys and men” (Hill, 2010).

**Figure 4**: Performance on a Challenging Math Test, by Stereotype Threat Condition and Gender. From the figure, when there is no stereotype threat, women and men perform similarly in scores (17 and 19). However, when stereotype threat exists and imposes on women, it would reduce women’s score from 17 to 5 and increase men’s score from 19 to 25.
   {:.caption} 

Faced with these biased convictions, women students are more likely to connect these social judgements with themselves and avoid fields of study related to STEM. Therefore, stereotypes act as stress, imposing “an extra cognitive and emotional burden of worry” (Hill, 2010), which negatively affects women’s performance in these fields. Nevertheless, there are a lot of career-related programs that help women prevail in their professions, such as Society of Women Engineers and Grace Hopper Conference. Women workers’ proportion exceeds that of men in certain occupations, including office and administrative support (17% and 8%), sales and retail-related occupations (12% and 11%), and business and financial (6% and 4%). In USC, the male-to-female ratio has approximated to 6:4 (57% and 43%). Although faculty members in fields of engineering and science augment the proportion to 7:3 (67% and 33%), the incoming class of students keeps creating new records of gender ratio (56% and 44%, Fall 2017) with the increasing female population in the overall student body.

![](images/Faculty_Sex_Composition_by_Field-1.png)
   {:.image}
**Figure 5**: Faculty Sex Composition by Field. For faculty members in Arts and Humanities, Medicine, and Social Science, the male-to-female ratio approximates to 1:1, which almost reaches the gender equality in these fields of study. However, for faculty members in Science and Engineering, the male-to-female ratio approximates to 7:3, because it is a traditionally male-dominant major of study.
   {:.caption} 

In other traditionally male-dominant programs and majors of study, USC has achieved the equality in male-to-female distribution. For example, “USC’s Marshall School of Business is the first major U.S. school to reach gender parity in its full-time MBA program” (Byrne, 2018). By creating an academic environment fostering the development for both men and women and strengthening the management to eradicate sexual harassment, USC has endeavored to achieve the gender equality in employment and education opportunities.

As people of different ethnoracial background, different types of jobs, and different types of educational levels work, study and live in LA, the city is fractured into various neighborhoods and people of different social status live in different parts of the city, contrary to some of other cities in the United States. Concretely speaking, the creative class in LA, associated with film, television, and entertainment industries, live alongside the coast while the service class clusters around living areas of creative class or even lives in suburbs on the edge of city. Unlike New York, LA does not share the same centralized structure, where “lower-wage service workers concentrated in the urban core and the more afﬂuent creative class at the suburban fringe” (Florida, 2018). Instead, “L.A.'s ongoing transformation and gentriﬁcation takes shape around a more spread out pattern” (Florida, 2018). It is often shocking to find that upper-class residents enjoy entirely different opportunities in employment and education from lower-class ones when they live just a street apart. For example, in the USC and Exposition Park community as a whole, most residents are employed in the services industry (79.5%). A large number of surrounding residents are employed as food-related and cleaning-related workers in USC. Every morning I go out, I can always see a 50-year-old janitor greeting me while mopping the floors. If I leave my room at the noon, he would rest in a cubicle with the door slightly open, which is only half the size of my current bedroom. On the other hand, distinguished faculty members could rest in spacious offices after lectures, which can accommodate at least 4-5 students comfortably. One of the biggest reasons of the disparity in the living and working environment is the difference in levels of educational attainment. As a consequence, service workers are not able to master sufficient skills to compete for intellectually-challenging, well-paid occupations, leading directly to a downgraded social status. 

In conclusion, race, gender, and class define everyone living in the USC community and LA. Even though these demographic differences constitute the cultural diversity so that people of different background, such as Justin, Stuart, and Alexandra, could study and live together here in USC, they largely influence people’s opportunities in employment and education. Racial minority prevents people from receiving an equal treatment and building relationship with others. Gender inequality discourages women from acquiring fairness and participating in traditionally male-dominant careers. Socioeconomic disadvantages trap people in condensed living and work space. As all of the demographic factors block the resources for certain subset of population in LA, it erects a wall separating the USC community from outside LA region.
