The La La Land for movie stars and celebrities, Los Angeles features wealth and the big sign on the hill. However, within 15 minutes from the Hollywood Walk of Fame, people are sleeping in the common area right in front of the Los Angeles City Hall. Homelessness is a serious problem in Los Angeles. Struggling to provide its downtown residents with adequate economic support to counter homelessness, the city needs to enhance the safety and health conditions of the homeless population and strive to open doors for them to live a normal life. The historical low-income status of Downtown Los Angeles has been made worse by gentrification in recent years, which elevated rent and the price of goods. The government is incompetent in terms of supplying shelter, treating mental illness and substance abuse, and providing permanent homes. Finally, a lack of training for jobs makes finding employment a challenge and the high minimum wage backfires on the jobless, while effective acts are not taken to reduce the discrimination towards those with a criminal record.

As a decentralized city, Los Angeles has its richer population outside of the city center, unlike many major cities in the world. Traditionally, cities are centralized – that is, “downtown” is usually the most prosperous area and provides the most services. For example, The City of London has a higher median household income than most of the suburban wards (districts) (Piggott). Los Angeles was established by Spanish settlers and grew throughout the years with a populous and prosperous downtown area. However, decentralization started in the 1920s, when the widespread use of automobiles collided with the booming of the real estate industry (Foster, 475).  People were able to commute farther away with their cars, so many that used to live in Downtown moved out to the suburbs, and businesses and services followed. As a result, the functions of DTLA were diluted, as people no longer relied on the services provided by a strong city center, but could alternately go to a closer satellite city. Those who could afford cars moved out of DTLA gradually, leaving the area with a generally poor population. The situation now is not different from almost a century ago, because people who ware fortunate enough to become affluent choose to move out of DTLA, following the convention set by the first people who have moved out. DTLA has the lowest household income of $15,003, far lower than the city’s average of $55,909 (LA Times, Mapping L.A.). Residents of DTLA are impoverished; they are vulnerable to financial crisis and more prone to and becoming homeless than residents of affluent neighborhoods. They do not have a lot of savings because of low income, so their financial status can be easily destroyed if someone in the family becomes ill or the factories they work at fire them. The low-income status of DTLA makes its locals susceptible to financial crisis and make them more likely to end up on the streets.

Recent gentrification has made things worse by raising the rent, but the city has not provided enough support for its already impoverished residents. DTLA’s high rises make a scenery in the city’s skyline, which shows its functionality as a business center. Gentrifications are carried out to satisfy the taste of the people that work here, at the cost that the people that live here can no longer afford those services. A UCLA study found that the higher the rent is, the more homeless people there are (Khouri), and the renovation of houses and apartments drives up the rent, which causes more homeless people on the streets. As of 2015, the median one-bedroom rent in DTLA is $2380 per month (Kudler), in spite of an annual median household income of $15,003. Clearly, many living in DTLA cannot afford the rent. Rent stabilization in DTLA is ineffective. There are laws that limit rent increase per year to 3% to 8% (Chiland), but aside from the qualification requirement for such rent control, the average increase in wage is often lower than 3%, such as 2.4% in 2016. This means that if a normal working family cannot afford their rent now, they will not be able to in the years to come either. The city's rent control policies are not enough to change the status quo, and those who cannot afford the rent end up on the streets. 
  
The historic and cultural sites that attract tourists to DTLA collide harshly with the scenes of tents and encampments on the streets. The city is eager to gentrify the downtown area for more tourists to come in. A study on gentrification in Chinatown shows that gentrification for tourism is occurring, but it impacts the elderly and low-income people the most, and Little Tokyo has suffered from similar circumstances (Lin). These places are being visited by tourists often and the city eagerly wants more revenue, so the city either carries out the gentrification themselves or permits companies to purchase lands and beautify the area. Consequently, cost of housing rises, as does the price of food and daily supplies. In the case of the Grand Central Market, food prices go up as restaurants need to compensate for the rise in rent to avoid shutting down business (Katz). While it is difficult for shop owners to reestablish themselves by starting another business or finding a job, the cost of living of residents in the surrounding area goes up as small shops close down. Both shopkeepers and customers are victims of gentrification. 
  
The city should prioritize serving residents over catering to tourists, but is struggling to keep the balance of growing its revenue and preserving the quality of life of locals; it is also deficient in helping the people that have become homeless. Homeless people should be kept safe and healthy while they are on the streets, and they should be given the opportunity to reestablish themselves. The lack of public shelter is a key problem present in LA. Los Angeles is among the worst at providing shelter for homeless people, sheltering only slightly above 20% of all homeless people, compared to San Francisco and San Diego’s around 40%, and far worse than New York’s over 95% (Holland). Shelters are essential for one's safety, health, and dignity, as they keep people under a roof and away from extreme weather. It also improves the city image superficially, which is what the city wants as well. Most of the existing shelters are run by non-profit organizations instead of the city, and face the difficulty of a lack of funds. In 2011, the Union Rescue Mission (URM), the largest private homeless shelter mission in the United States, had to close Eimago, one of its affiliate shelters, which provided beds for over 600 people.  (Marcellino). Shelters lack governmental funds, which causes them to shut down and the homeless lose their shelter and home.

If a lack of shelter is a minor ailment which people can endure, mental illness and substance abuse is a major issue. It negatively impacts their potential for a normal life and led to their presence on the streets in the first place, and a lack of treatment and regulations will only make things worse. DTLA is in the Metro. L.A. Area, one of the Service Planning Areas that the county is divided into. 31% of all homeless people in this area are “seriously mentally ill” and 19% have “substance use disorder” (2018 Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count). Constituting a significant percentage in the entire homeless population, these people need special service and treatment, as those mental illness and substance abuse not only affect their health and well-being, but also may pose safety threats to others. LA Times reported that L.A. County has a massive reserve for the treatment of the mentally ill, but is not actually spending the money (Curwen). It does not help the mentally ill by keeping the money, but actual treatment might bring them the capability of a normal life, or at least ease their mental illness so that they do not pose threats on others. Substance abuse is also prevalent in homeless communities. Drug use is common among young homeless people (Rosenthal). City officials ought to take actions to improve this situation, because there are people that become drug addicts under the influences of their fellow homeless neighbors. Worsening the case, some drug dealers, only pretending to be homeless, sell drugs in their tents. This scenario makes it hard for the government to provide help to the people that are really in need. A loophole in the law activates this drug dealing chain: police officers can only arrest a person if they see drug dealing in action in order to practice respect for privacy and fairness, because the police cannot arrest someone that they only suspect is involved in drug dealing. No easy fix exists, but what might be helpful is to enhance the rehabilitation facilities, familiarize homeless people with the harm of drugs, etc. In conclusion, financial support and administrative acts should be in place to cope with mental health problems and substance abuse.

Those with serious mental illness and substance use disorder often experience “chronic homelessness”. An individual with a disabling condition such as mental illness and substance abuse is chronically homeless if he/she “has been continuously homeless for a year or more”, or “has had at least four episodes of homelessness in the past three years” (Defining Chronic Homelessness). That is, he/she either is homeless for a long time, or is homeless frequently. Mental illness and substance use impair their ability to work and live as normal people and increase the likelihood that they stay on the streets, or return to the streets, because they may not be able to maintain themselves even when they find a home. But this situation can be helped by just providing permanent housing. Currently, many permanent housing programs are “treatment first,” requiring “detoxification and sobriety” before qualifying homeless people for housing services. On the contrary, a “housing first” program provides housing regardless of their mental health or drug and alcohol use status. A study in New York proves that compared to those in treatment first programs, people in housing first programs show an equal level of substance use, and a higher percentage actively seeks treatment (Padgett 79-80). It turns out that housing first programs are more effective than the well-intentioned treatment first programs. Treatment first programs often disqualify homeless people because of their health status, but housing first programs succeed in both providing homes and mitigating health conditions.

In addition to providing permanent homes through housing first programs, the city should pay more attention to empowering the now homeless to live a stable life again by providing training for jobs and reducing discrimination against ex-prisoners. Homeless people are less popular in the job market, and this limits the possibility to start a normal life again. 43% of the population is under-skilled or under-educated (Acuña). People here cannot afford training or education, as they are poor and on the streets, so it is hard for them to change the status quo on their own.  Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority does have job training programs, but it is not enough. Few job training programs are helping little compared to the large population of those in need of training. Minimum wage, from another perspective, is not helpful in this situation. While minimum wage guarantees the life quality of those with a job, it prevents those without a job from finding one. The higher the minimum wage is, the higher the unemployment rate is, not to mention the unemployment rate among the homeless, the majority of which did not receive a proper education and can only perform low-skilled work (Brown 512). Employers tend to hire fewer workers because they have to pay the minimum wage for low-skilled work. 
  
Skills can be trained and gained for many, but ex-prisoners often face a harsher situation. They are often low-skilled, and the society is biased towards them. "seven in ten prison inmates function at the two lowest levels of both prose and numeric literacy, meaning that they are unable to fill out a Social Security or job application..." (Petersilia 366). Ex-prisoners are often low skilled, and they face discrimination because people believe they are dangerous. If the low skill is a tolerable issue because one can always acquire new skills, those who have been imprisoned can hardly be helped. Ex-prisoners often feel like they are discriminated against because they have been to prison (LeBel 73). The question of prisoners’ reentry into society is beyond the scope of this essay, but surely one of the challenges they face is discrimination in the job market and the workplace. The city is providing few jobs for ex-prisoners, which undermines the effort of prisoner rehabilitation, because a person that cannot make a living out of the prison is more likely to commit crimes again. It is not helpful for the society if the government only put criminals into jail but cannot make sure most of them won’t commit crimes again when they get out.
  
In summary, the soaring cost of living in DTLA is displacing people from their homes; for the people already on the streets, the city fails to provide life necessities such as shelter, treatments for illness and disabilities, and permanent homes; further, the possibility of restarting a normal life is low because of discrimination towards the low-skilled and ex-criminals. The city needs to put in more effort to ensure the quality of life of current residents with a home to prevent worse homelessness and treat the homeless population better with shelter, healthcare, and job opportunities. While movie stars and celebrities are enjoying their famed status, the people sleeping on the city hall’s doorsteps won’t think that Los Angeles is their La La Land.
