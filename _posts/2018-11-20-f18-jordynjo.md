Aesthetic Dreams and Urban Nightmares: Compton’s Place in our Cultural Imagination
 
>“We never churn people out or turn people away. We help them grow with love, always with love… because for us, the most important thing we can do is put young people first, let them know they are welcome, know that they belong in galleries.” 

These words have continued echoing in my mind since one Roland Coleman took me aside and began explaining to me the importance of art in the Watts community. Mr. Coleman, a lifelong staff member at the Watts Tower Arts Center, a cultural center originally started to curate and guardian the Watts Towers, was alluding to something that far transcended the scope of the center’s original goal. What Mr. Coleman, not in so many words, wanted me to understand was that the center was about more than just preserving the art that emanates from the community… the center exists to preserve the community itself. Teaching youth that their art belongs in galleries does more than continue the legacy of activists and artists like Elliot Pinkney, it combats the negative images of the city that mainstream media continues to propagate. In this way, people like Coleman, and Pinkney before him, define their own culture. While internally the cities of Watts and Compton define themselves through their rich cultural relevance in both music and visual art, externally they are seen as metonyms for the educational deficiencies, crime, and perceived need for gentrification that plague many urban centers. Thus it is important to understand the key demographic factors that contribute to why Compton’s, and to a lesser extent Watts’, external perception does not match the city’s internal notion of identity. In order to comprehend the seemingly dual identity of the city, as both a dissolute urban center and a thriving artistic haven, it is important to recognize the demographics at play; in both a historical and contemporary context, Compton’s culture has been drastically shaped by systemic race and class issues. Furthermore, these issues prompt the city to be understood by prevailing white society not as an improving urban landscape, home to a vibrant and robust community of artists, but as a cite primed and ready for large scale gentrification. Despite this however, internally Compton situates itself at the heart of many of Southern California’s art movements. Regardless of how they are perceived, residents of Compton define their city in terms of the beauty it creates rather than the negative image created for it.


Much of the negative image Compton has garnered is directly linked to their association with high levels of gang violence. Such violence is seen as a hallmark of the city, an idea propagated by Compton’s reputation as the birthplace of the gangster rap music subgenre, and is perhaps, externally, the most recognizable aspect of its identity.  As Josh Sides points out in a 2004 article, 
>"the explosive rise in Black street gangs in Compton and throughout Black Los Angeles during the 1970s,” not only coincided with but was in fact fueled by the area’s decline in employment opportunities. Sides goes on to suggest that, “black gangs went from, in the 1940s and through the 1960s, protecting Black youth from white segregationists to being largely ‘internecine’” (Sides 593). 

This shift in the city’s gang landscape prompted nothing but the death of Black youth and rise in crime on either side. It was with this that white segregationists were given the fuel they needed to paint what was once an ideal Black American suburb as an urban nightmare. In a later section of the same piece, Sides goes on to reveal that by the 1980s Compton had,
>"began its dreary metamorphosis from place name to a metonym” (Sides 596). 

Instead of being an inner city with a unique and complex bevy of issues, the name Compton began to represent something far more sinister. Rather than simply defining a city in Southern California, the very name “Compton” began to represent the decadence of a modern urban city. Furthermore, John Ritter puts it plainly in his piece, 
>“Compton, just south of the Watts section of Los Angeles, was a thriving middle class black suburb in the 1950s until its job base eroded and it devolved into a gritty, working class enclave where gunfire is a daily event and even churches have bars on the windows” (Ritter 2).

Here, Ritter seems to echo Sides’ point. The violence and gunfire that is so often talked about when discussing the city of Compton is a product of the large-scale exodus of white segregationist homeowners and white-owned businesses that refused to accept, hire, or integrate with their new Black neighbors. 

Following WWII, as more Black Americans found themselves comfortably in the middle class, they began migrating to the suburbs of Southern California; this, in turn, drove white homeowners out and led to cheaper housing and decreased property tax. With the funding of local schools being reliant on property tax and socioeconomic demographics, this began what would be an era that saw the drastic worsening of the Compton educational system. More than race and class leading to job loss and gang affiliation, they are directly related to the educational deficit Compton continues to deal with even in the present. Quite simply, as Gary Putka states, 
>“With their students poor, urban and 99% minority, Compton schools serve a city of 86,000 in the gang heartland of south-central Los Angeles County” (Putka 2).  

He then notes that within the 10 square miles of Compton territory, there is no single school or block that is free from the hold of one of the about 40 Black or Hispanic street gangs. Moreover, Emily E. Straus’ novel goes into even more detail, proposing that the socioeconomic profile of Compton directly relates to the success, or lack thereof, of the cities students. As she writes in her novel, 
>“The long-standing educational and economic problems remained and Compton schools would continue to flounder because they stood on an already anemic financial base and a suburban structure that limited opportunities to build a stronger foundation” (Straus 128). 

Thus, Compton is plunged into a downward economic spiral, residents continue to become poorer, which in turn means that potential employers move out of the city, and poverty increases. This causes the schools to underperform, as the local economy, property value, and tax returns begin to decline to the point of almost complete disarray. And the cycle continues, playing out over the course of various generations. In Straus’s own words, 
>"the increase in poverty caused rising crime, lowered student achievement, and created embittered students, teachers, and parents.” As one report she mentions even states Compton schools more often than not, “ill-preparing their students and, as a result, limit[ed] the students’ future opportunities and foster[ed] a sense of hopelessness and frustration” (Straus 109).

And this continues today. Based on census data, out of the 99% minority population of Compton only about 9% have a college degree, and only 56% graduate high school. Thus, the issues of race and class contribute directly to the poverty, violence, police brutality, and lack of quality education that externally define Compton.

In addition to educational deficiency and gang violence, Compton often finds itself defined quite simply by the poverty that pervades the city. As mentioned before, Compton was at one point a high middle to upper class white suburban area. As time progressed and businesses continued to relocate outside the city, jobs dried up and left what were originally well-off middle-class Black Americans without jobs and the inability to relocate. As Sides points out, 
>“The Negro did not move into slums, for once he moved into good housing” (Sides 588), 

suggesting that at first the Black families that moved into Compton did so with the promise of escaping the trials of urban living. However, as white-owned businesses and corporations sought to hire fewer minority workers, the wealth was moved out of the the city we now know as Compton. This began to, Straus reiterates, 
>"lay the groundwork for the unrest. Jobs, along with large grocery and department stores, had moved to suburbs populated by more white demographics. In Watts, unemployment rates held at double those of the Los Angeles metropolitan region and the state of California” (Straus 108). 

This was in no way helped by the increase in police brutality that threatened those that minority community members seeking to find work in the city. Even now, as census data shows, about half of Compton’s residents are below the middle class completely and only 20% are above the lower middle-class range. Based almost solely on race and class, Compton can be understood in the cultural imagination as being not just defined by, but itself the definition of an impoverished, crime-ridden, educationless urban dystopia; the product of de jure segregation, tax issues, and police brutality, Compton has come to be defined externally as a dark reflection of the brutality of urban living.

These demographics have a profound impact on not only how Compton is seen externally, but on the issues Compton faces, primarily issues created by external forces. The gentrification of Compton is fostered by a negative community image held by those outside the city. Larger gentrification movements are only possible if the group of people gentrifying see the area with which they plan to gentrify as having less value; more than simply being a cheaper real estate option, gentrification relies on the dominant group not valuing the culture or significance of the groups already populating the area. And because of the aforementioned demographics and the problems that arise as consequences of them, Compton is viewed as an easy target for the wealthy elite’s gentrifying efforts. 
>“The inner city has been hit hard by the neglect of the L. A. political and economic elite, and now the elites are proposing to attack the problems by attacking the community” (Chaubey 1), 

one Vik Chaubey says before addressing the development strategies pushed by these groups that seemingly, “have no benefit for inner-city communities.” As has been already discussed, rather than helping the less funded schools that serve much of Compton’s minority youth or dealing with the problem of over policing, 
>“New schools, new police facilities, and jails, new rail lines are being used as part of a strategy of population removal, replacement and control” (Chaubey 1). 

Despite having now reached a Hispanic majority and electing its first Latino city council member, Compton has historically had problems with their elected officials favoring gentrifying elites over underserved urban populations (El Nassar 3). One such example was  LA Mayor Villaraigosa’s 2008 effort to push for a USC owned medical research “industrial park” near the Compton area rather than provide aid programs helping the poorer urban populations already there (Chaubey 3).

On the surface, gentrification is problematic for a number of reasons; whether displacings large groups of people without any affordable housing options, contributing to the growing wealth gap, or continuing to perpetuate de jure segregation ideology, gentrification can be understood as largely negative consequence of urban development. This understanding of gentrification, however, does not address the larger cultural implications of changing one areas demographics completely. As Alexander Nazaryan states, referencing a community group in LA trying to fight a number of gentrifying efforts, they are in a constant struggle to keep their neighborhood from becoming another example of a 
>“formerly Latino neighborhood overtaken by glass condominiums full of white people who have come from Beverly Hills, or maybe the hills of Arkansas” (Nazaryan 1). 

Much like other activists who fought gentrification in the neighborhoods of Silver Lake or Echo Park, Nazaryan addresses one of the main concerns of many community organizations: as one group is pushed out, as was the case with Chavez Ravine, a Mexican-American community that was destroyed to build the new Dodgers Stadium, their community, and more importantly, their culture, is destroyed. In the same way, Compton is seeing its vibrant art scene begin to feel pressures from the influx of white business and art galleries. Thus, Mr. Coleman’s wisdom becomes more clear, “we let [youth] know they are welcome, know that they belong in galleries.” He makes sure youth in their community know they belong not simply because he wants them to know that their work could one day end up in galleries, but because galleries can be owned by people that look like them and because most galleries tell them, even in the community they live, that they do not belong. This is echoed again by Nazaryan, who suggests, 
>"the galleries are a proxy for corporate interests, especially those of high-end real estate. After the galleries will come the coffee shops and bars, and after that, the restaurants that serve bacon in cocktails. After that, unkempt lots empty for decades will be boxed in construction plywood, and then there will be many hollow promises of affordable housing” (Nazaryan 2). He goes on to describe a struggle in which the “techno-fluent elite” clash with the “less-skilled underclasses, intimidated by cosmopolitan culture,” 

and finally ends with the grim retelling of Jesse Romero’s story; Romero was a young man gunned down by police, who, only suspecting he held a gun, were called by gallery owners after Romero tagging “fuck white art” to the side of their building. And thus gentrification efforts seem to give a stark message to neighborhoods like this: our white art is more valuable than the lives of those of color (Nazaryan 7). Despite this problematic and, in many cases, harmful understanding of Compton as a cite of urban dilapidation and a city in need of “development,” we can instead understand Compton in terms of its own cultural identity.

From the interviews collected, it is clear that the people of both Compton and Watts are familiar with their demographics; the residents of the city know their history as a cite for black migration, they understand their growing Hispanic population is infusing the city with a new kind of culture, and they are also aware of the lack of wealth, propensity for crime, and lack of quality education that has, for so long, plagued their city. Rather than define themselves solely through these demographics, as many gentrifying groups so often do, much of Compton’s population, in both a modern and historical context, chooses to understand the city in a way that transcends census data and statistics. Internally the city defines itself by way of the art produced there and the opportunity it has to become an urban center that celebrates black and hispanic identity, street art, and a unique culture birthed from a tempestuous history of gang violence and socioeconomic issues. This is evident in a recent parent reform in a few local Compton schools. These parents, “filed suit, alleging that the district's tactics violated both their rights to free speech, guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution, and to an education, promised by the California Constitution,” and were able to replace the principle, much of the staff, and re-charter the school (Newton 3). Rather than accepting their external identity as fact, these parents sought to make a change in their community. Moreover, the new Compton mayor, Mayor Aja Brown, has set, “goals for turning the city around now include attracting large businesses to bring their headquarters to Compton,” with the ultimate goal of drawing young families to live there. Mayor Brown has even been able to foster a truce between two of Compton’s major gangs, in hopes of fostering a decrease in crime and promoting education (Allen 4). Instead of writing off Compton as a city without culture, internally Compton is taking steps to better itself, with the hopes of preserving its culture. Part of preserving this culture is preserving the art of the city and teaching those outside Compton what value it has to the city.

When beginning to understand the impact art has had on Compton’s culture, it is almost imperative that artist Elliott Pinkney is touched on. Before doing field work or even census research, I first began understanding Compton using Elliot Pinkney’s life as a lens. Pinkney was born in Georgia during the mid 1930s and after living much of his young life in the south, he moved to the city of Compton, following a brief stint in the Air Force. He would live and create in the city for over 20 years. Over this two decade span, Pinkney made music, sculptures, paintings, and prints with whoever would collaborate with him. By 1977, his work was so prominent that he was given a grant from the California Arts Council to create eight murals around the city. He would go on to continue creating art all over Compton even after this project was concluded. Pinkney made a point to always work with local youth whilst creating his pieces, even stating in one of his project proposals, “[it] celebrates the rich diversity and talents of youth while providing neighborhoods with public artworks.” In almost all of his proposals or article interviews Pinkney describes the importance of giving youth art. For him, “giving youth art gives them a voice.” His works never failed to display a diversity of individuals from different cultural backgrounds working together and coexisting. This rich history of beauty however, is a perfect example of the clash between Compton’s internal community and those that seek to take advantage of it. Pinkney’s work provides yet another instance of art destroyed or taken away when a gentrifying population moves into a space. As each property Pinkney painted was bought by someone outside the community, very few people stepped in to [conserve his art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uft3BQl7-a8). In this way, the community loses notable and inspiring art from an artist that looks like them. And for what... another art gallery opened by a group of rich urban developers? When asked about this, Ronald Coleman, the same man who pulled me aside to speak one on one, could only share in my grief. As it turns out, he was a student of Pinkney’s and even helped to paint a few of his murals. Mr. Coleman had watched Pinkney create, and that is what prompted him to spend most of his life working at [The Watts Tower Arts Center](https://youtu.be/DUg6J3Ew_ZY), teaching his own art students.

Pinkney is, although one of the more historically prominent Compton artists, far from the only example of a Compton artist that is keen on giving back to their community. As another worker, Sherie, at The Watts Tower Art Center communicated, artists like Chukes, a sculpture who has had pieces in the White House and Oprah’s private collection, and Nipsey Hussle, an American recording artist, return to their center often for special events. Art still serves as a platform of hope to the people living in these communities. They still cling to their artists to bring the city life, and these artists continue to deliver. The art pieces produced here and the artists that grow to flourish out of this community are what the people of Compton use to define their own identity. And when these artists return for the large jazz festival hosted in the city every year, or the galleries they bring back, or the students they teach, they are shaping the community. This cycle, the cycle in which young people look up to artists and use the city as inspiration only to return and inspire other, is the only thing that can truly combat the cycle of oppression that has plagued the area for generations.

I believed when I went around to Pinkney’s murals, retracing his steps, that the art of the city was gone. That a place that was once its own kind of open-air gallery, with art lining every block, was now destroyed by gentrification. I saw the Watts Tower Art Center and other galleries like it as the last remnants of a city and culture soon to be replaced by condos and galleries for the wealthy elite. But I was narrow-sighted. Pinkney’s master work was never one of his murals. His greatest pieces weren’t his prints. His greatests works were his students, and his masterpiece… the city itself. The people he taught and the culture he helped create, that was the most beautiful of all his creations. Ronald Coleman, a man who had helped to run a community gallery since he was a teenager, the same man who was now inspiring me, told me that he got his start because of Pinkney. Yes, socioeconomic issues, primarily those dealing with race and class, still affect the area. The population is only about 1% white and most residents live below what is nationally considered the middle class. And drastic reforms are indeed necessary if Compton wants to improve the schools in the city. But this is only half the story. Often, from the outside, Compton is understood only through this lens. Those with the capital to buy up the cheaper Compton real estate have been, and although people have been slow to move into the community, a demographic shift is likely on its way. Internally however, Compton is fighting this. Rather than understanding who they are in terms of what others think, the people of Compton are quick to point out that their culture too has value. Musicians, visual artists, and sculptors are looked to as pillars of Compton’s community. It is with this backbone of brilliant artists that they have been able to combat both negative stigmatization and deal with long standing historical problems. Thus, despite class and race demographics having shaped the community and created a negative perception of the city, Compton has clung to its own definition of what “Compton” is and what that name represents. So I do believe Mr. Coleman when he says, “they belong in galleries.” But I believe the better question is, do the galleries owned by the wealthy elite, these “white galleries,” deserve to come in and be a part of the rich artistic tradition of Compton without contributing anything to its community? Is it not they who do not belong?
