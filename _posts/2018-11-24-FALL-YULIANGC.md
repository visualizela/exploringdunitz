  There she stands, between a pair of large angelic wings with white feathers surrounding dark-blue ones with a hint of yellow. The wings are spreading out in a taffy pink background. She is wearing a pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses and carrying a coach bag in her elbow. One of her friends is taking a photo of her in front of the mural while the others are editing theirs before posting them onto Instagram. Across the street, there is a designer retail store with another mural on its wall. The mural says “Being naked is the #1 most sustainable option. We’re #2”. This is West Hollywood in 2018. If not for the number of hippies on the street and murals on the walls, this place can well be mistaken as Beverley Hills. It is filled with expansive restaurants and fashion stores. Tourists from all over the globe are swarming on the streets of this neighborhood. Under the surface, however, there is a group of people that are strongly connected to the history of this neighborhood. The LGBTQ residents shaped West Hollywood, and this identity of the neighborhood sheltered the community during the most vulnerable times. Not long ago, this place was only inhabited by a few railway workers. Later, due to West Hollywood’s advantageous geographic position, individuals of the LGBTQ community started to gather here and seek shelter from social oppressions. The AIDS epidemic drove even more people, many of whom were not ready nor willing to come out of the closet, into this land. The community started to utilize political power to fight against the discrimination and oppression they suffered, shaping West Hollywood into an oasis for LGBTQs living in a world of prejudice. While there are great advancements of gay rights in recent years, this equality comes with a price. The LGBTQ community living in West Hollywood started to debate whether integration into mainstream means a loss of identity to the neighborhood.  
  
  Being a relatively young city, West Hollywood’s statistics have not significantly changed over the past decades. West Hollywood was an unincorporated place, often referred to as “Town of Sherman,” before it became a city in 1984. The place was initially a settlement for railway workers and gained popularity as the film industry boomed in Hollywood. The first official census is the census of 1990, six years after the incorporation. Compare it to the estimated census of 2017. There is neither a significant population change (36118 in 1990 and 37080 in 2017) nor an outstanding racial composition change (90.2% White, 3.6% Black, and 3.0% Asian in 1990 vs 79.1% White, 4.4% Black, and 5.2% Asian in 2017)  . It seems like the city had already taken its shape and solidified before 1990. Most of the major events that shaped the West Hollywood we see today may have happened before and during the incorporation of the city. This hypothesis is also backed up by the change of the most important community-LGBTQ community- in the census. Using gay males as a snapshot, 41% of the city’s population in 2000  were gay males while this number decreased slightly to 39% in 2013 . The numbers are too similar to mark any significant differences, indicating a lack of drastic changes in the neighborhood during this period of time. In order to understand how this neighborhood is shaped and defined, we have to dig deeper into the record of history and study the early days of the neighborhood, when it had not become a city named West Hollywood. 
  
  In the mid-20th century, social oppressions against the LGBTQ community was overwhelming, and this led LGBTQ individuals to form communities with political consciousness. After the society welcomed an open air towards homosexuality briefly in the 1920s, there was a conservative backlash in the 1930s. Homosexuality was considered as a mental illness and treated with brain surgery if not electrical therapy. This conservatism even escalated post-war. In November 1970, two Chicago police officers caught James Clay Jr., a twenty-four-year-old, and “fired eight shots into his back, killing him” for “wearing women’s clothing” and “[having] a long arrest record that included charges for impersonating the opposite sex” (Steward). While the mainstream recognized homosexuality as a type of mental illness, the police departments took it one step further. They perceived the LGBTQ community as a crime community. Without support from the mainstream, individuals of the LGBTQ community were vulnerable when facing police brutality. There are other events that triggered LGBTQ individuals to gather together and support each other. During the time of Lavender Scare, federal and state governments “investigated and fired thousands of employees who were suspected of being gay or lesbian, claiming that they were ‘security risks’ who were vulnerable to Soviet blackmail” (Sherouse). Though terrifying and unfair, this event had some positive impact on the community. Most fired people were former government employees, making them political conscious. Furthermore, this event brought more visibility to LGBTQ people as it forced many previously hiding identities to come out. The net result was that these political conscious individuals started to seek each other out and form communities that embody political power to better protect themselves against social oppression and discrimination. 
  
  West Hollywood became one of the most popular neighborhood for LGBTQ individuals due to its preferred geographical position. Before West Hollywood became incorporated and turned into a city, it was a town called Sherman and it was a settlement spawned for railway workers building the Pasadena and Pacific electric railway. It was not part of city of Los Angeles because people of Sherman refused to be incorporated. This was perfect for the LGBTQ community as West Hollywood was “beyond the reach of the notoriously homophobic LAPD” (Highleyman). At West Hollywood, people didn’t need to worry too much about being apprehended or shot by the police for dressing in their preferred gender. The lack of police influence also made Gay and Trans brothels flourish in the neighborhood. Furthermore, West Hollywood was also “convenient for the Gay creative talent working behind the scenes in the film industry” (Highleyman). The success of Hollywood’s film industry in the mid-20th century attracted a tremendous amount of Gay talents. Proximity of the two locations made West Hollywood a perfect neighborhood to settle in for them. People started to gather at West Hollywood for different reasons. Some came to avoid police brutality, some came for the open air and brothels, some came for a homey neighborhood that is close to work, and others came to form a political entity that can protect the LGBTQ community. These reasons brought together a dynamic community with members coming from different backgrounds and having different specialties, forming the backbone of the future West Hollywood city.  
	
   Fast-forward twenty years to the 1980s, the already vulnerable LGBTQ community faced yet another disaster, which not only took away many lives from the community, but also strengthened the already chocking social oppression against the gays. AIDS, when first observed, was perceived to be an epidemic that only infects gay men. The disease was coined GRID with the meaning of gay-related immune deficiency. This became a weapon for gay-haters to exploit when they fire their concerns about gays. People started to falsely accuse gay’s life style as the causation of AIDS. Cleve Jones, founder of the NAMES Project that created the AIDS Memorial Quilt, mentioned in an interview that, “There was a Republican state party convention here in southern California — I don’t remember what year, but very early on in the epidemic — and they had a bumper strip that said, ‘AIDS: It’s killing all the right people’ ” (The Age of AIDS). It became a nightmare when a deadly disease was portrayed as a justified cleansing towards vulnerable groups of society. It is also a seductive argument to make towards people who don’t know much about the disease, which was comprised of the majority of the general public during the early days of the epidemic. People even started to link AIDS to be an act of Nature. In a speech Jerry Falwell, a prominent televangelist and Southern Baptist pastor, gave in 1983, he claimed that, “ I believe that when one breaks the laws of nature and the laws of moral decency — and I do believe homosexuality is moral perversion — when we go against nature — and God, of course, is the creator of nature — we therefore pay the prices for that. We do reap it in our flesh when we violate the laws of God” (Fields). This argument quickly gained traction among the public, especially those who possessed strong Christian faith. Some of the churches perceived homosexuality to be sinful while others consider it to be a temptation towards sin. This historic factor was utilized by gay-haters to sway people into thinking that AIDS was a messenger sent by the God and the infected deserved the suffering they were facing. This fortified the already choking social oppression against gays and such discrimination often led the diagnosed to be distanced. 
	
   More gays were socially isolated when diagnosed with AIDS as they were forced to come out, ready or not, and often then condemned by friends and family. This epidemic infected a great portion of the community. According to CDC, the diagnosed number in the United States quadrupled from 50,280 during the period of 1981-1987 to 202,520 during the period of 1988-1992 (“HIV and AIDS – United States, 1981—2000: Table 1”). Considering at the time most infected people were gay males, the impact was huge on the gay community. The diagnosed people could feel their lives being changed immediately. During an interview in 1982, Bobby Reynolds, a gay male lived in Los Angeles, shared his desperation, “When you are diagnosed with AIDS, very often you lose your support system. You lose your families. You lose your job. I have lost the majority of friends that I had before my diagnosis” (The Age of AIDS). The infected not only lost their body’s immune system, they had also lost their social last line of defense. Feared and distanced by their friends and family, they were isolated when they needed support the most.  In such a desperate situation, they could only seek support from people who had similar experience. That is, they could only seek support from each other. One neighborhood that stood out was West Hollywood. The neighborhood had a growing number of residents that were part of LGBTQ community. Many of which were also victims of the AIDS epidemic. AIDS victims started to gather at West Hollywood. 
	
   The AIDS epidemic drove many of the LGBTQ community members to come out and seek protection from West Hollywood. Being a gay in the 1970s and early 1980s was hard. Many people chose to hide their sexual orientation in order to protect themselves from social oppression and maintain the relationships with friends and family. The emergence of AIDS changed this completely. Once a person is diagnosed with AIDS, he must come out, even if he was not prepared to, which was often the case. This is because AIDS was coined to be a gay men’s disease and the infected would likely to tell his family and friends about this life-threatening disease. Ed Jackson, director of program development at AIDS Treatment Information Exchange pointed out that “the large number of HIV-positive men, and the often-overlooked contributions of many lesbian women who cared for the sick, forced members of the gay community to interact with the system, instead of living on the margins…gay rights came incrementally as these battles were waged before administrative tribunals and the courts and, in the process, gay and lesbian couples became more mainstream” (Picard). Now that they were distanced by their family and friends, and their lives threatened by AIDS, many of them had less to fear. More gays were more willing to put on a political fight as hiding in the closet was no longer an option. At the beginning, these fights were seemingly trivial, such as the right to see partners who are hospitalized due to AIDS. These requests echoed among the gays and people started to gather together in order to form a political entity that can protect the gays and lesbians as a whole. As a result, the city of West Hollywood was formed. “West Hollywood was incorporated on November 29, 1984 and elected the first-ever city council with a Gay majority and the first openly lesbian mayor, Valerie Terrigno. The council quickly passed strong rent control and anti-eviction laws and an ordinance banning antigay discrimination” (Highleyman). With the support of the city of West Hollywood, those infected with AIDS can concentrate on fighting the disease instead of worrying about being evicted by landlords due to discrimination. As a result, the neighborhood attracted even more individuals of LGBTQ community during the latter half of the 1980s. Residents called it a city of Gays with pride. With its political efforts, gay culture gradually integrated into mainstream and discriminations against LGBTQ community were greatly reduced. West Hollywood also began its transformation into a mainstream city. 
	
   The presence of LGBTQ community in West Hollywood has been integrating into the mainstream culture over the past years. Three decades have passed since the discovery of AIDS. The three-cocktail therapy and prevention drugs such as PrEP contained HIV’s spread. HIV carriers are no longer feared and condemned by the public. During the same time, Gay rights have advanced drastically over the past decades. Gay marriage in California became legal in 2008 and the same applied to all states in 2015 under a supreme court ruling. It was less a confronting position between the LGBTQ community and the mainstream. Rather, the community is integrating itself to be a part of mainstream culture. Taking a walk in West Hollywood neighborhood today, it is very hard to spot any murals with AIDS related theme. Murals are a primary weapon used by marginalized groups to express themselves and sometimes as a weapon to fight mainstream. LGBTQ themed murals are underwhelming in this city famed for its gay pride. The most probable explanation is that people no longer think tha  t they are confronting the mainstream. As the society treats a gay couple just like a straight couple, and as it sees a HIV carrier no different from a non-carrier, the line between LGBTQ community and mainstream is blurred.

Hollywood locals are displayed by a crowd surrounding a bus, which carries tourist-like figures. There is a clear demonstration of hippy culture among the crowd, but significant LGBTQ-related symbols are lacking from the mural. This representation is the identity of modern day West Hollywood in a nutshell. The neighborhood’s hippy background still stands out while the LGBTQ aspect of the community seems to be assimilated into the mainstream. This in many ways is a victory for the community who has fought for its rights for decades. 
At the same time, however, integration also leads to the loss of identity, which is criticized by some members of the community. Today’s West Hollywood is a tourist’s favorite. The streets are filled with designer stores and tourists from all over the world. It also serves as a cultural center for straight and non-straight hippies. When old gay bars are replaced by fancy restaurants and high-end retail stores, there is a growing concern that West Hollywood is losing its identity as a city of Gay and turning into Beverley Hills East. In an article by Marco Colantonio in WeHo Times, he points out that the iconic Rainbow Crosswalks placed at the historically significant intersection of Sanata Monica and SAN Vicente Boulevards, where the LGBTQ community used as its battleground for voicing dissatisfaction to the government, are “now worn, sun-bleached and weather beaten…[and] on the verge of vanishing” (Colantonio).

He also argues that the city government does not care about the LGBT community as it used to because it is “spending 90 million on Phase II of renovations of West Hollywood Park” and “16 million [on] an automated parking garage” while providing no paint job to the symbol of Gay pride, the Rainbow Crosswalk (Colantonio). While some people are glad that West Hollywood is no longer dreaded by mainstream due to its high percentage of LGBTQ residents, there are people like Marco Colantonio, who worries about the city government putting too much effort on integrating into mainstream that it sacrifices the identity of West Hollywood. Coming from a different cultural background myself, I feel this fight between cultural integration and segregation. This fight can be either big or small. It can be me debating whether to correct my friend during lunch time and point out that Panda Express is not real Chinese food, or I can try to blend in by saying that fortune cookies are my favorite. The answer I found over the years is to choose neither complete cultural integration nor segregation. The middle ground, though tender, is the perfect grey area for me to retain my cultural identity while blending into mainstream. Similarly, there should be a balance between gentrification and LGBTQ identity at West Hollywood. The hardships and challenges that the neighborhood has faced should be remembered while West Hollywood embraces people from all over the world. 
	
   It has been a long run for LGBTQs to build their own city at West Hollywood. They initially came to the neighborhood as a means of escape. They tried to flee from the notorious LAPD, and from friends and family who distanced themselves upon hearing their AIDS diagnosis. As this neighborhood grew older, the community that lived there also grew stronger. They learned to fight back, and their weapon was not violence nor bloodshed. The city of West Hollywood was founded with an unprecedent presence of gay and lesbian members at the top. The city council passed numerous laws against discrimination. The fight continues even today. The LGBTQ community is fighting to preserve its identity while integrating into mainstream culture. The history of West Hollywood is weaved into the history of gay rights. It was the LGBTQ community that shaped the city we see today. In the future, there might be a new Instagram-popular mural, and except for this time, the angel wings are colored by rainbow paint.
