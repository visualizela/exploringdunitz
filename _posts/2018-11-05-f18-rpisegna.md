I walk along the glistening sand when I notice before me a group of volunteers cleaning up trash along the shore, watching in awe as they wave their trash grabbers in the air to proclaim their satisfaction at having found another piece of garbage. Curiosity and excitement ensues, as I, being just 5 years old, make it my mission to ensure healthy sustainability in my hometown of Santa Monica. As a coastal oasis, the Santa Monica-Venice beachside area is shaped by its large influx of visitors and residents. This prestigious beachside neighborhood is characterized by its highly desirable nature, which has resulted in a more competitive real estate market. Public transportation has assisted greatly in reducing the amount of traffic impacting this intimate residential area, while government incentives encourage emissions-free travel. The neighborhoods’ vow to expand the presence of ecotourism allows for visitors to receive educational opportunities to learn how to live sustainably in order to protect the land’s resources.

Native American Tongva peoples settled the area in 1769; it became “Santa Monica” to Catholic settlers in the mid-1800s, who were inspired by local springs that reminded them of flowing tears that Saint Monica shed for her wayward son Saint Augustine (Scott 17). Initially established as a beachside community in the early 1900s, Santa Monica underwent a vast expansion following the establishment of several major businesses including the Douglas Aircraft Company in 1921, Merle Norman in 1931 and Sears in 1947. A significant amount of infrastructural growth, such as the development of the Santa Monica Freeway in 1966 and the Santa Monica Mall and promenade in 1990, assisted in strengthening Santa Monica’s economyand ensuring its continued expansion throughout the mid-to-late 1900s (18). Today, Santa Monica continues to grow and enlarge its popularity and fiscal revenue due to increasing demand for business expansion and housing.

The Santa Monica-Venice neighboring area is seeing a significant increase in the demand for housing: Limited housing market inventory causes a spike in housing costs with many developers flipping older homes and selling them at over twice the original price. As hi-tech companies open branches in Venice, they further limit the space for residential property. During the first 6 months of opening in 2013, Silicon Beach generated profits exceeding 500 million dollars hereby also becoming one of the top 3 tech hubs in the world. Companies such as Snapchat and System1 generate annual profits upward of several hundred million dollars and have employed thousands of new workers. Venice now caters to the wealthy business managers that are re-developing this coastal neighborhood, thus also reshaping the demographics of this area. Consequently, rental prices in Venice increased by 17% with the median price being $4,857 (Langlois). The rising development of Silicon Beach spurs these high housing prices as this area becomes an increasingly desirable neighborhood.

As housing prices increase, the rental costs grow. Timeout magazine claims that “Santa Monica is one of the most rapidly-increasing rental markets in the state of California.” A separate study found an estimated yearly price increase of 7.1% for rental properties in the Santa Monica-Venice area (Martin). It is evident that this popular neighborhood hub is experiencing extreme price increases at an alarming rate, thus indicating that renting a property is no longer considered a more affordable option for residents who cannot afford to purchase a home. However, the city governments of Santa Monica and Venice have made a significant progress in the number of properties offered as low-income housing for underprivileged individuals desiring to live in this neighborhood.

The Housing Choice Voucher program under Section 8 was developed for low-income families looking to live in Santa Monica. The program allows for participants to pay 30% of their income for their rent while the program funds the remaining cost to cover the total rental fee. Families that qualify to be covered by this program make an average annual income of $48,450, with price limits adjusted depending on the number of family members (City of Santa Monica Housing Division). The city of Venice has allocated similar opportunities such as the one offered in Santa Monica to underprivileged individuals. In addition to offering apartment housing covered under Section 8, Venice also has constructed specialized public housing apartments, low income tax credit apartments and non-profit senior apartments. Although the strikingly high housing prices in Santa Monica and Venice render the area exclusive to the wealthy individuals who can afford to live in this area, the cities have organized special measures to allow for the less privileged to be residents. For several years, Section 8 has encouraged low income individuals and families to apply for this program. However, today they are no longer able to accept further applications due to a significant demand of properties and a substantial lack of housing market supply, thus demonstrating the restrictions in the housing availability.

The limitations of housing are being further fueled by the development of offices that were previously rent-controlled apartments. According to Bianca Barragan from LA Curbed, land owners are invoking the “Ellis Act, a state law that allows owner to boot tenants from a rent-controlled building in order to take the building off the rental market.” In doing so, building owners are preventing themselves from having to abide by rent control regulations, thus allowing them to charge higher prices for rent. This issue is creating an even greater housing dilemma for locals and demonstrates how the Santa Monica-Venice neighborhood is catering to businesses rather than to its residents.

Along the Venice Canals, a mural representing houses being torn down by business conglomerates is plastered onto a neighboring 1920’s colonial home. Ironically, the structure is situated between several neighboring homes undergoing construction as well as having a “For Lease” sign plastered onto one of its walls, an indication of how drastically the housing market is changing. The art display, known as the Jaya Mural, depicts joyful families playing on the beach before a fleet of bulldozers begin to tear down their properties. Anguished facial expressions and tears fly off the homeowners’ faces as they reflect on their new reality: Venice has become a business opportunity. Cathy Horn, a Venice local, proclaims that “the real estate market is getting more and more expensive. I’ve definitely noticed that older and smaller homes are getting torn down and built into mega mansions that are four times the original price.” A blissful walk through the Venice Canals is not as serene as it once was, withsounds of construction crews at every block working on finalizing a new, modern mansion that is sure to raise the prices of Venice housing and contribute to the decline in residential parking.

The city of Santa Monica houses a population of 92,478 residents, resulting in limited parking availability. Many residents and visitors utilize public transportation systems in order to avoid this dilemma. In a busy urban city where “commuters spend a hellish 164 hours a year stuck in a traffic jam,” the establishment of a Metro Expo line in addition to the Big Blue Bus line help to ease the burden of Los Angeles road traffic. The Metro limits roadway congestion for people wanting to travel to the scenic Santa Monica-Venice coastline. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti stated that “for the first time in 60 years, you can go from the skyline to the shoreline by train.” Public transportation is revolutionizing the way in which visitors can experience this magical city, while also re-shaping the demographics of people in this area and limiting the pollution levels released into the atmosphere (Watts-Russell).

By 2020, Santa Monica vows to triple its public charging stations in addition to offering free parking in a bid to incentivize people to drive electric vehicles (EV). The Santa Monica City Government explains that this plan provides “a comprehensive strategy to increase access to public and private charging infrastructure, synchronize parking policies and develop outreach and education programs to increase awareness.” Santa Monica vows to reduce its carbon footprint while also allowing for its residents and visitors to benefit from practicing a more sustainable lifestyle. By increasing the usage of EV vehicles in Santa Monica to 15%, “Santa Monica will save 25,690 tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year.” Santa Monica is looking to expand opportunities for sustainable travel in order to make a lasting impact on the environment (City of Santa Monica). These ecologically sustainable values are being employed towards other key aspects that are a fundamental component of the Santa Monica lifestyle, such as ecotourism.

Ecotourism allows for visitors and residents of Santa Monica to indulge in all of the exciting events and opportunities that are available while also limiting pollution and engaging in sustainable practices. The city of Santa Monica welcomes approximately 8.4 million visitors annually, resulting in $1.87 billion in profits (City of Santa Monica Economic Development Team). Many efforts are employed to ensure that local businesses follow up with local ecotourism guidelines so that pollution is minimized as well as the city’s carbon footprint. Many of the city’s profits that are garnered from the tourism industry are being utilized to restructure ecotourism opportunities. In doing so, the city has allocated a significant portion of funding towards hosting community-wide events in order to address environmental concerns while also allowing visitors and tourists to indulge in the brimming sense of sustainability. Such events and initiatives are organized by the city government and sponsored by community and private organizations.

Santa Monica’s Go Green initiative offers a wide variety of ways for visitors to be part of a sustainable community centered around protecting the environment. Heal the Bay is a nonprofit organization aimed at protecting ocean wildlife and marine animal conservation that hosts frequent clean ups to help keep beaches clean and free of trash. Furthermore, the Annenberg Community Beach House allows visitors to indulge in organic dining within its sustainably constructed interior composed of recycled blue jean material while also providing educational seminars about how to be more sustainable. The biweekly Santa Monica Farmers Market allows visitors to purchase locally-sourced organic produce while neighboring restaurants and businesses are beginning to source more sustainable goods on their menus and shelves. The Pacific Wheel perched on the Santa Monica Pier is the first and only solar-powered Ferris wheel in the world and is one of the most significant historical staples in the city. Furthermore, many hotels are promoting LED lighting, solar panels and reduced water use in a bid to be a part of the city’s ecotourism movement (“Go Green in Santa Monica”).

The Santa Monica-Venice beachside neighborhood is characterized by its breathtaking views, golden sunsets, developing businesses, and sustainable living opportunities. While a high demand for people wanting to live in this area has led to a price increase of the housing market, the cities additionally provide more affordable housing opportunities. A rise in the influx of visitors to this popular destination has expanded the public transportation infrastructure to limit traffic in this area. Santa Monica is using this visitor platform to spread awareness about sustainable living so that others may become more educated about environmental issues while also being able to work together to solve them. In this majestic oasis one may walk down a cement bike path across the sand dunes to witness the horizon playing a fine tune across the ocean waters. Over the Thanksgiving break, I returned to the beach again to reflect upon my mission to enforce sustainability, this time toting my trash grabber and a few volunteers at hand. As I stand here today, where I once stood at just 5 years old, I have realized my desire to work for the city government’s environmental protection branch as it is my passion and civic duty.
