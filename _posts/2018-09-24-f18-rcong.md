Every time somebody hears the letters “USA”, they most likely think of New York of Los Angeles. These large cities are the heart of the country and are filled with an electric atmosphere. Los Angeles is a booming metropolis with a steady economy and year-round warm weather, so it is not surprising that it is a popular city to live in. But in Downtown LA, there is very little space for housing and the traffic in the area, which has been agreed to be the worst in world, makes living away from all the action very difficult. Downtown Los Angeles is designed – whether intentionally or not – to reward the rich and punish the poor. Skyscrapers take up almost all of the available real estate and reduce the amount of space available for housing while driving up prices. Hostile architecture is implemented in public spaces to drive away the homeless and treat the poor like criminals. Advertisements posted all over the area advertise products for entertainment, distracting everybody from the issues that plague the city.
A big problem of Downtown LA is that most spaces are reserved for businesses instead of housing. Being the second most populated city in the United States, Los Angeles’ downtown is constantly bustling with people. That many amount of people concentrated in one area will obviously lead to issues with space. This is where the skyscrapers come in. They are built to conserve space and instead of expanding across the ground, they optimize their capacity by stretching up into the sky. Skyscrapers can offer space enough for dozens of floors while only taking up a block of the city on the ground. The presence of these tall buildings shows the city’s emphasis on productivity and efficiency. They are often used for businesses and sixty-three percent of all skyscrapers are used as offices, due to their high demand for employees and workspace (“The Skyscraper Center 2018).
Nineteen percent of skyscrapers are used for residences, but this is not as good as it seems. Residences in skyscrapers are extremely expensive due to the amount of construction required to build them. When residences are built into skyscrapers, “buildings get too tall, construction costs become high, making floor space more expensive” (Florida 2016). This makes living in skyscrapers very difficult for lower and middle class families, and there are factors that even drive up housing that are not built into skyscrapers.
	In a city with a booming economy and an electrifying atmosphere, living expenses are extremely high and not affordable for many people. Many of the apartments that are built in the area are very high end and designed to attract rich customers, like the one shown here. The Downtown Center Business Improvement District says that in the second quarter of 2018, the average effective rent per unit was $2,603 (“Residential Growth” 2018). Prices like these can only be afforded by the higher class, and they are going up every year. But why these prices are so high is again due to – one way or another – the skyscrapers. There is something called the Balassa-Samuelson Effect – which is named after the two economists who created it – states that prices of prices of local goods and services depend on income. Balassa and Samuelson claimed that income was determined by a worker’s productivity, and in Downtown Los Angeles, where offices take up entire skyscrapers, productivity is at a maximum (Thompson 2012). Therefore, income is high and according to the Balassa-Samuelson Effect, so are prices of housing. This can be manageable for the few that are able to find a high paying job in one of LA’s high-rises but everybody else housing is way too expensive. So not only is there a lack of housing in Downtown LA, but the housing that is available is too expensive for anyone to live in. This leads an excess of people without homes and some taking up a life in crime.
With every big city comes a great deal of people and can lead to overcrowding and crime in certain areas. Hostile architecture is used to combat these problems by preventing public space from being misused. For example, many public benches have dividers on it to prevent people from laying down on the bench and sleeping on it. Los Angeles is filled with people without homes, and who this architecture is
designed to fend off can be a controversial topic. There 
has been debate about whether hostile architecture is something that improves the community or discriminates against certain groups.
Some argue that hostile architecture is meant to have a positive impact on the majority, and that it does. They say that public space should not be a place where people hang around, but instead a means for getting from one place to the other. When the public space is overrun with homeless people and criminals, nobody benefits. Additionally, sometimes hostile architecture can help those that it is designed against. For example, “public health researchers have noted that people who ride their skateboards in skate parks are much less likely to get injured than those who ride on city sidewalks” (Licht 2017). And if modifications that drive away skateboarders from the streets are implemented to public structures, a lot of injuries can be prevented. More often than not, hostile architecture is used as a tool to benefit not everyone, but the vast majority and make the community, as a whole, more ideal. Hostile architecture can also be used to prevent crimes. Locked gates and security cameras are all examples of hostile architecture and can be used to reduce crime by preventing break-ins and robberies.
Even though hostile architecture does sometimes help the community, it is designed mostly to undermine homeless. We should not oppose the homeless but instead help them, giving them a place to lie down such as a bench in the subway. However, the way it is now, objects are designed to be uncomfortable to keep people from loitering and keep them moving. Hostile Architecture can sometimes be beneficial, but it is everywhere in Downtown LA and is too excessive. Spikes installed onto sides of buildings to stop birds from nesting there just show how disrespectful hostile architecture is. James Furzer said to CNN, “Not only does it look unattractive and aggressive, it shows the selfish nature of society and its thoughts on the environment” (Lo 2017). Designs like these that drive away not only people but also animals have no place in this society and are completely unnecessary. But most importantly, these designs are used “as an instrument for urban segregation – to separate those entitled to access public space from those deemed undesirable” (Gillies 2018). In most cases, the people “deemed undesirable” are the poor and driving them away only hurts them more. Hostile architecture is just another way to further separate the underprivileged from the elite, and the people of the city are oblivious to its effects.
 Much like hostile architecture, advertisements can negatively affect people’s lives and be found all over Downtown LA. Most of these advertisements center around entertainment and superfluous products such as smartphones or alcohol. Many companies use advertisements to take advantage of people and distract many them from what is important by convincing them to buy things that are not necessary for everyday life. Sometimes companies use celebrities to show that their product is meant for “superstars” which will make people want those items. Around every corner is a collection of advertisements on busses, billboards, and sides of buildings. They are designed to be unavoidable and catch people’s attentions. 
Many people say they don’t have a problem with advertisements because they think they can just ignore them and tune them out. However, it has been proven not to be true. Two researchers – Melanie A. Dempsey and Andrew A. Mitchell – conducted an experiment on affective conditioning, which is the act of associating an item with positive things to make it more appealing. In this experiment, the researchers told people about two pens, one objectively better than the other. In another experiment which the subjects thought to be unrelated to the pens, the researchers flashed images on a screen to the subjects that paired the worse pen with positive things while pairing the better pen with negative things. After when the researchers asked the subjects what pen they would buy 70-80% of the subjects chose the worse pen (Markman 2010). Those researchers concluded that “consumer’s purchasing decisions are driven in large part by implicit associations with the imagery connected to a brand – and rely on the subconscious emotional appeal of a product much more than consumers may suspect” (Palmquist 2010). This experiment shows the power that advertisements have over our decisions without us even realizing it. Advertisements have more influence in people’s lives than they expect and can cause dire consequences. 
After taking these marketing strategies into consideration, it is not a surprise that these advertisements have a heavy impact on not only what people buy but also the way the act and think. “Culture is more affected by advertising, because images used in advertising are often idealized, they eventually set the standard which we in turn feel we must live up to” (“UK Essays” 2016). Advertisements give people high expectations of products that in the end will not really have a huge impact. People feel they need to buy these things to be happy or successful. This is becoming an increasingly significant problem in big cities. Below is a chart from the US Census Bureau showing the estimated aggregate revenue of the advertising industry in the US for each year. There is an overall positive relationship between time and revenue for companies over the years. As companies learn which advertising strategies work and improve their technology, more people are influenced into buying their products.
When people that do not have a lot of money to spare waste their money on these unnecessary items, they dig themselves into a deeper hole and do not have enough money to buy the things they actually need. Additionally, advertisements can mislead people about health and can cause decisions that have dangerous consequences. There are advertisements for alcohol all over the city, and none of them state the dangers of alcohol; they all just emphasize the pleasure and fun alcohol can bring. When people believe that these products can improve their life and make them happier, problems start to arise.
Downtown Los Angeles is an area with a mix of cultures and activities, but it is designed to help the rich and hurt the poor. Skyscrapers only make finding permanent housing harder and drive up prices for everybody. Hostile architecture shows the city’s neglect for the homeless and its futile act of trying to treat the symptoms instead of solving the problem. Advertisements divert people from what actual matters and puts unrealistic expectations into people’s minds. The way Downtown LA is structured right now will always put a clear divide from the more fortunate and the less fortunate. When people think of the Los Angeles they should not think of a city where the rich and the poor are divided, but a city that accepts and cares for all of its people.
