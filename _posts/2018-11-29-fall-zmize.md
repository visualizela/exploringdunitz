For many, it is hard to conceptualize living in history from nearly seven decades ago. In fact, more than half of the United States population, including myself, have lived or are currently living in such history. Since World War II, suburban neighborhoods have come to exist all across America and are continuing to grow at a fast rate. Until age eight, I partook in this history by growing up in Nichols Hills, Oklahoma, a city boarding Oklahoma City that fits nearly perfectly into the category of a suburban neighborhood. Around 1300 miles away exists a city that mirrors Nichols Hills in that it too is a suburban area bordering a large, nationally known city. Northern Hollywood is a suburban neighborhood where the suburban culture has come to shape its residents’ lifestyles and perspectives by engaging them with interaction and a sense safety, providing economic and social differences from city life, and allowing for space and optimism that come from living in a suburban area. Through things such as lower crime and cultural interaction, North Hollywood is able to form a sense of community that may not form as easily within cities. Suburban lifestyle, specifically in North Hollywood, differs from city life economically through cheaper property and accessible amenities as well as socially through more regular, genuine interaction. It is because of all these things as well as the space that comes from living in a suburban area that a sense of ease and optimism is able to exist among North Hollywood’s residents.

The post-war era of World War II not only brought a revival from the Great Depression and a changing image of women in society, but perhaps most important, in this context, it brought the rise of suburban culture. Suburbs exist all across America including Southern California with cities like Anaheim and Irvine in Orange County which have come to define a national suburban image. However, located less than 100 miles north exists a suburban neighborhood hidden by the overlying image that is Los Angeles. North Hollywood is a near picture perfect example of a suburb with its location bordering the city of Los Angeles along with its large residential population and relatively affordable homes. As the Los Angeles Times puts it, “relatively affordable houses are making North Hollywood a destination for strivers looking to own a piece of the American Dream” (“Neighborhood” 2). This American dream of starting a life in a desirable, opportune location is not just experienced by a white population as most suburban cities came to be after the war (Nicolades 3). North Hollywood now exists as an ethnically diverse community where Caucasian people are actually a minority. Among the city’s population, 43.6% are Hispanic, 41.1% are White, 6.8% are Asian, and 5.5% are African American; the other 3% of the population are of different ethnicities (“LA” 7). With an ethnic residential population, North Hollywood most certainly can be categorized as a diverse, suburban neighborhood. 

A community is something that exists in almost every area of the world. It can be as little as recognition of other people's presence all the way to a feeling of family with the people involved. However, a greater sense of community is what aids in providing a more positive reputation for the city where the community exists. The community within North Hollywood would not be as strong as it is today if not for the suburban culture that has come to occur. Due to this suburban culture, residents are protected from the crime and negative influences that can infect an area from the inner roots of larger, more dangerous cities like Los Angeles. When examining North Hollywood’s crime rate, it is revealed to exist at 2,838 people victimized per 100,000 people annually which is right at the national average and is nearly 400 people below Los Angeles’ average which is 3,193 victims per 100,000 people (“Times” 1). This perception of protection is not just an imaginary sense. Residents truly feel this and embrace this feeling as seen in the architecture of their city. Unlike some homes in Los Angeles, many are modestly gated or not gated at all in North Hollywood and very few have barred windows for added protection. A majority of restaurants and businesses also embrace a sense of safety by using minimal protection of their property.

As resulted by suburban lifestyle, the minds of North Hollywood’s residents have been impacted with a communal sense of protection. Through lower crime and a small negative atmosphere as a result of safety, a sense of community is able to strongly exist and thrive within the city. Because of this, North Hollywood’s community contributes to a positive reputation for the city, further encouraging the community within to grow. 
 “Community” is not just an empty term. Rather it is something that can physically be seen through the various aspects of the suburban neighborhood. Recreation centers and parks line the neighborhood where residents are able to freely attend year-round. Instead of clashing against each other, ethnicities are able to blend and coexist together as seen by shopping plazas with Greek, American, Hispanic, and Asian shops as well as various religious churches existing in close relation to one another. As Ama Otet, a resident and real estate philanthropist describes it, North Hollywood consists of a "mixture of long-time residents, recent immigrants, and a steady influx of writers, artists, actors, filmmakers, and musicians" (Otet 2). This cooperating blend amongst the amenities of the neighborhood serves as physical proof of a thriving community despite ethnic and background differences.

Admittedly, recreation centers, parks, culturally diverse shopping plazas, and various religion churches close in proximity are all things that exist amongst some city life and most likely within Los Angeles. In fact, Los Angeles is well known for its recreational and social options it provides (Pitt 2). However, the interaction, and thus the community formed is much different. Due to a smaller population existing in a less dense area, more regular interactions are able to occur from suburban life. Cities are often heavily populated and constricted by traffic meaning familiar faces are less frequently seen and lasting, genuine relationships that exist within a strong community are harder to form. Communities that wish to require desirable social interaction amongst its participants where emotional connections, and thus a sense of true community, can form (Makes 1). These interactions and emotional connections can prove to be harder to form due to the busy, stressful city environment, making community less achievable outside of suburban life. The community within North Hollywood is not congested with large amounts of traffic and is relatively lowly populated as compared to the city of Los Angeles. Thus, the community is not constricted and is able to grow through the genuine, regular interactions that come with North Hollywood’s suburban life. 

Economically, the suburban lifestyle of North Hollywood varies quite differently compared to Los Angeles city life. This is seen not necessarily in the types of jobs but rather the way to get to such jobs. Like most suburban cities, North Hollywood often requires its residents to commute long trips, often spanning upwards of 20 miles into Los Angeles in order to reach their jobs. The residents are forced to do this simply because of the lack of offices and work opportunities inside of North Hollywood. Residents want to be able to earn a stable income, so they resort to the vast amount of opportunities within the city. These long trips often require vehicular transportation which can contribute to smog and also can be quite costly for residents (Nechyba 181). Not only do these long hauls affect the pocketbooks of residents, but they also can affect them socially. Long trips in traffic can often contribute to large amounts of hours wasted away annually. Residents are forced to give up time within their day which could be spent as downtime to relax from a stressful work environment or time with family and friends. A great example of suburban life negatively influencing residents can be told by the story of a man named Stanek "who lives in downtown San Diego [and] walks 3 minutes to his office…in Orange County, he could spend more than 3 hours a day in the car commuting” (Suttell 39). City life may allow residents to not have to come across this problem. Rather, they are able to have easier commutes to their jobs which not only saves them money, but it provides more time within the day to be spent destressing or to be enjoyed with others. It is hard to find many things within life that do not come with downsides. Suburban lifestyle does have its downsides which people contemplate before deciding where to live however positive qualities are surely taken account when making this decision, especially in North Hollywood.

The social and economic benefits from living in a suburban culture are quite present and are prominently expressed by the residents of North Hollywood. Residents are able to avoid expensive land costs and high property taxes by choosing to live outside of the city where the property is much cheaper. Given a location that sits above a world-renowned entertainment capital, is less than 30 miles from the beach, and is sparred from hot, humid summers and harshly cold winters, North Hollywood should have large property values. However, the median house price is $540,000 which provides a decent size home and is relatively cheap when compared to other neighborhoods similar to North Hollywood (“Neighborhood” 3). Space can be quite important because with space comes opportunities for residents. These opportunities can be as simple as more gardening space to expand a dream garden all the way up to purchasing land to begin a start-up business. It is described in an article by the Los Angeles Times that “North Hollywood is the best choice for them price-wise because they get more property for their money”. Property can also be treated as an investment with the rising economy, meaning if residents would not only be investing in their personal wealth by buying land, they would also be investing in their neighborhood. Space is a very valuable thing that many people neglect how important it is; an importance that city life struggles to accommodate due to minimal space available and expensive pricing.

North Hollywood is in no way perfect and consists of various negative traits such as less access to public transit but they minimal in affecting the neighborhoods overall image. However, the city does carry one prominent negative trait: a lower net household income than the instate and national average. There could be a lot of reasoning behind this fact, however, the most reasonable answer is most likely due to the lack of education that exists amongst the residents as well as a fairly young median resident age. With only 30% of the population carrying some sort of degree and a median population age of 34.6, it is most likely to reason that these stats factor into North Hollywood being behind on the national income average (“LA” 1-2). Although lack of higher education is often viewed from a negative standpoint, one could make the argument that Northern Hollywood is embracing the suburban lifestyle. With its separation from busy work environments and heavy traffic, suburban lifestyle has motivated them to spend time on morally important things such as family and friends rather than larger commitments such as an intense high paying job. The young median age could also fit in with this argument as it is around that age statistically that families begin or are continuing to develop. It can be inferred that parents would much rather spend more time with their children and spouse than away from them in an office. Some would say that with a lower income, families will be inclined to find higher paid more intense jobs due to the stress that comes with tight budgets. However, that does not seem to be the case as a suburban lifestyle has continued to influence residents as the median income has stayed relatively similar as to past years. 

Suburban culture influences its residents in both positive and negative ways but perhaps the most abstract way is through the sense of optimism that its residents are enriched with. Through the ability of more space and separation from a large work environment, suburbs, specifically, North Hollywood, offer an opportune place for growth economically and psychologically. With more land readily available, businesses are able to construct new office spaces which can boost the local economy by providing more jobs. citation Residents can also take part in this economic boost and experience psychological growth by fulfilling a dream using the relatively cheap land to construct their own local business like a restaurant or contributing to a new aquatics center. Regardless of what new facilities are to come, a suburban area within North Hollywood provides for a heap of opportunities. City life may be hitting its peak due to its lack of space and minimal residential environment, but North Hollywood is on track for an optimistic future where residents will be able to enjoy the mysteries that are to come

Without lower crime and a shared sense of safety, it can perhaps be assumed that the community would just be an abstract idea in North Hollywood if not for suburban culture. However, a strong community does, in fact, exist due to the suburban culture that also contributes to economic and social differences such as cheaper property and regular, genuine interactions which can be much scarcer in a city lifestyle. North Hollywood's suburban culture expands its influence past economic and societal aspects and through the space provided by suburbs, residents are enriched with a unique sense of optimism that cannot be found within city life. Through suburban culture, residents of North Hollywood have had their lifestyles and perspectives influenced through a strong development of community, economic and social differences from city life, and larger space to create optimism. As a young adult who is only a freshman in college, living in a suburban neighborhood is not a high possibility for myself. For the next few years, I will most likely live in a neighborhood close in proximity to college where the factors within my neighborhood are of the last of my worries. However, as I grow older, through the deep examination of suburban culture as seen in North Hollywood, I feel as though I will be better educated and be able to reflect back on my examination of North Hollywood, and suburban cities as a whole, when I am deciding where to live.
