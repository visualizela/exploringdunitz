“You are the reason Venice has gone to shit!” A resident of Venice Beach claimed that one might hear such a statement being shouted by a local at tourists or wealthy individuals (Manatakis). While “shit” might be a bit of an overstatement, depending on one’s perspective, the consequences of gentrification in Venice are undeniable. In 2012, GQ called Abbot Kinney the “coolest block in America”; since then tourist numbers have escalated and the introduction of numerous technology companies have induced the phenomenon of gentrification at an incredibly rapid and far-reaching rate. Once known as the “slum by the sea”, Venice is now a vastly different area because the effects of rapid gentrification have changed the overall composition of Venice and its demographics, causing its laid-back, idiosyncratic artistic culture to give way to a highly commercialized, affluent area. The root cause of this intense gentrification is the arrival of Snapchat and other such tech companies, which in turn catalyzes commercial changes and housing escalations that alter the target audience for which the area is marketed. A consequence of this critical shift is a diversion in the type of people who can afford to live in Venice, jeopardizing the economic diversity necessary for a healthy city, pushing out minorities who are caught in the effort to erase “gang violence”, and promoting the criminalization of homelessness. The plethora of social and economic adjustments undoubtedly and inevitably have a palpable effect on the inspirational artistic culture characteristic of Venice, stamping out the potential of a modern Beat generation and mirroring the plight of the modern artist in the diminishing artistic culture of Venice.

In 2013, Snapchat relocated its offices to Venice Beach, which instigated a rapid revolution of the entire identity of the neighborhood, disrupting the mellow nature that its residents were accustomed to. Because Snapchat adopted a more decentralized campus look, instead of the customary single tall office building, they flooded a majority of the available office space. Due to the limited office space in Venice, residents are being shifted out and buildings are being bought that are meant for residential but are being used as commercial or business property”. Thus, it is evident that not only are the perceived priorities of Venice forcibly being shifted towards being conducive to further tech development, but the very act of doing so also has enormous effects on office space costs. As depicted by the chart to the right, office rent prior to 2013 hovered around $45 per square foot, with natural minor fluctuations in the market, and available office space was just under 10%. After Snapchat’s arrival, however, from 2014 onwards, the rent price jumped more than $20 per square foot, accounting for a 43.50% change from the previous year. Furthermore, the amount of available office space embarked on a sharp decline (Sisson). All of these factors contributed to rising office costs, which made it more difficult for smaller entities to compete with a giant like Snapchat. Even for common residents of Venice, the Snapchat’s arrival affects their daily lives, with people reported that “increased security around the [Snapchat] buildings” and “patrolling” made locals feel “nervous” in their own neighborhood (Manatakis). Not only are customers of surrounding establishments scared off, creating a further detriment to local companies’ endeavors to survive in the quickening pace of commercial development in Venice, but the fact that residents feel “nervous” in their home speaks volumes to the total revolution that Snapchat has brought upon the area. Even after Snapchat announced its decision to relocate to the larger spaces of Santa Monica, its initial presence there served to open “the doors for similar startups and tech companies”. This prospect effectively erases the potential for Venice to revert to its original, unencumbered “beach town” state. In the one year that a local cafe became a “private Snap cafeteria”, the owner of a Rastafarian clothing shop said that “revenue fell 30%”(Dave). Rastafari is a Jamaican religion later popularized by Bob Marley, and such shops help create the unique atmosphere of Venice that distinctly distinguishes it from other such towns (“Rastafarianism.”).  This reveals that collectivizing the commercial prospects of Venice under tech needs further propels the dismantling of the distinctive flair that characterizes the city. Tourists flock to Venice to see the “unordinary”, manifested in the form of oddities sold in small shops — quite the contrary to the austere “offices” Snapchat has set up and the chain stores that have taken over.

The steep escalation in office rent prices have not been an isolated phenomenon, one palpable consequence is the alteration of the entire commercial infrastrastructure of Venice to become one more concentrated on luxury and affluent tourism. With the escalation in rent prices, “corporate chains” are turning the characteristic “funky lineup of artisan shops and antique stores to a ritzy outdoor mall of upscale corporate brands, such as Scotch & Soda, Hyden Yoo and Sofia Kaman Fine Jewels” (Kuznia). The inherent commercial appeal of Venice is now moving from one of idiosyncratic, artsy shops to one that effuses extravagance in form of “fine jewels” and higher-end couture. In 2013, one “commercial property” sold for $20 million, but two years later was purchase by a “New York partnership” for “$44 million”, more than double what it was two years prior, consequently forcing “the ejection of Hal’s, a landmark bar and grill”(Kuznia). With this type of price increase, it grows increasingly difficult and improbably for existing commercial entities there to be able to afford the rent on their storefronts. Furthermore, given that the young, tech employees who have recently inundated the area, are by means financially challenged, with the average Snapchat employee earning a salary of $99,000 in 2018 (“Snapchat”), these new shops are fittingly catered to the new crowd in Venice. However, these new changes are reflected not only in the residents of Venice, but also in the tourists. With the cost of everything from shopping to real estate shooting up, the low supply of hotel rooms has jumped in pricing, causing the overall cost of visiting the area to increase as well. As a result, Venice no longer remains a travel destination for many average-income Americans (Friedersdorf). Without this segment of visitors to cater to, local businesses must redirect their attention to the richer tourists who can afford to not only visit Venice, but spend their money at these high-end establishments. While even those who do not live in Venice can render an impact on the neighborhood and the community there, residents of Venice have greater problems that also concern financial increases. 

But for those who do reside in Venice, the challenges extend beyond the commercial sector, into the housing prices, making it difficult to even remain a resident in Venice. Since Venice has been included in the group of LA and OC cities dubbed “Silicon Beach” for their location near the beach and innovative companies, demand for dwellings in the area have increased greatly (Schroer). Even areas like Oakwood, which has traditionally been a predominantly African American neighborhood, have experienced increased interest in the property there, due to the “Silicon Beach” effect and its proximity to the beach (Maria). Given the high demand and the limited supply of housing in Venice, in tandem with real estate investors’ eagerness to capitalize on such an opportunity, the property prices in Venice have jumped dramatically in the last few years, as with most Silicon Beach housing prices. Since 2012, Venice housing prices have jumped 54%, from about $1 million to hefty median of $1.98 million at the start of 2017, now costing more per square foot than properties in the famously expensive neighborhoods of Bel Air and Beverly Hills (Chiland). Taking into account these immense escalations, many long-time residents of Venice who have been there for over 20 years have been evicted by landlords who are trying to take advantage of rising housing costs, tearing apart the fabric of the laid-back neighborhood of Venice in decades past. For example, ballet teacher Angelina Meany and her husband had rented the same bungalow duplex for 18 years, but were forced to move out in 2013, an eviction that “completely disrupted their lives” because they had to try “commuting back to Venice [from] 30 miles south [in] Long Beach” everyday (Kuznia). Many of the ones who have managed to hold their ground in the fast-paced development of the new Venice have often “resisted newcomers, complaining about congestion on roads and public transportation and seeking to preserve architecture, sunlight and views” (Friedersdorf). “Congestion” and “public transportation” are aspects that push it towards a more urban milieu, detracting from Venice’s quaint, beach town appeal and estranging local, longtime residents who are accustomed to the slower pace of life. Although the economic factors that are pushing Venice closer to an urban city, its lack of diversity is leading Venice towards a sort of counterintuitive state that fails to fully include various groups in society.
Forces of gentrification are starting to alter the demographic of people who can afford and are willing to live in Venice, consequently and inevitably altering the original makeup of Venice Beach. A study conducted by Harvard, UC Berkeley, and US Treasury revealed that cities with more upward mobility tend to have things like “greater social capital and economic diversity”. One of the Harvard researchers, Nathan Hendren, noted that cities in which “poor minorities are separated from everyone else” suffer from the “lowest rates of economic mobility” (McEvers). In other words, people prosper the most when they live in an area characterized by economic diversity. This poses a problem in Venice, where nearly 25% of households in Venice earn more than $150,000 (“Demographics/Neighborhood Info: Venice”) , which is more than twice the US median household income of $61,4372 (Appelbaum). However, it is growing difficult for the neighborhood to attempt to maintain or even restore economic diversity in the housing because landlords often chose not to fix things and  force old tenants to move out, before raising their prices and welcoming new tenants to move in. It has become a growing concern in Venice because although many of the newcomers are young innovative, problem-solving entrepreneurs, the reality is that doing so is not a reliable way to generate and enforce affordable housing policies, thereby threatening the economic diversity of Venice Beach. As an unassuming beach town, Venice in the past was a haven for struggling artists and people from all walks of life to come for inspiration and for a safe place free of judgement. With the mushrooming economic predicament, however, the prospect of that sanctuary inches further away from reality, as Venice becomes a hub for the rich and the successful, further setting up insurmountable barriers for those who are economically disadvantaged as well as racially marginalized.

The gentrification that has consumed Venice is not limited solely to a economic basis, but rather, has extended its effects to racial gentrification, marginalizing non-white groups and further inhibiting potential socioeconomic advancement. Police gang injunction is a law enforcement strategy that bans gang members from convening in allotted “safety zones”. Alex Sanchez, Homies Unidos co-founder, said that the gang injunctions are not truly effective for their intended purpose because oftentimes “neighborhoods that have been ravaged by gang violence are not the ones that reap the benefits of gang injunctions”. The core issue with the concept of gang injunctions is that they are employed in the name of gentrification, targeting specific groups of residents and consequently raising “concerns about unnecessary policing, gentrification, and displacement” (Gebreyes). The police of Venice, in particular, enforce gang injunctions in Oakwood, nicknamed Ghost Town for the clear segregation of African Americans in the past, with the tacit goal of targeting and pushing out people of color. One person of color said he could “be detained [for suspected gang activity] just for greeting a friend in the street” (Carroll). The consequence of this kind of prejudiced behavior has estranged a large number of black residents, halving the population since 1980 from 9.6% to 5.4%, with the effect of the escalating real estate prices in Venice also playing a contributive role. Even many of those African Americans who owned shops on Abbot Kinney “voluntarily took their equity and left” due to the increasing racist practice of gang injunction and fear of violence from hostile attitudes (Carroll). Given Venice’s previous state as a laidback place for creative expression, it seemed like a neighborhood with the potential for a “great multiracial, multicultural community” to take hold. However, with 67.1% of the population being white (28.7% more when compared to the overall state of California), Venice’s lack of racial diversity serves as an inhibiting factor in creating a more creatively diverse and welcoming culture for artistic ideas for foster (“Race and Ethnicity in Zip Code 90291). 

While nomadic hippies and travelling artists were characteristic of the Venice of decades past, the broadening disparity between socioeconomic classes and racial divides has generated tension between the wealthy urbanites and the homeless population. With a history of a rampant homeless problem, Los Angeles County’s number of homeless hit 47,000 in 2016, a number that, given the current lack of resources and decisive legislation, is susceptible to grow. The City of Los Angeles has the highest density of “unsheltered” homeless people, or those “who are quite literally living on the streets, in cars, in stopgap refuges”, making up “75 percent of its total homeless population”. In Venice, there are about 2000 individuals living “on or around the Venice boardwalk”(Czachor). Especially with the quickening pace of gentrification in Venice, there has been conflict brewing, with the criminalization of homelessness becoming a prevalent divisive matter with the police. In 2015, a policeman shot an “unarmed homeless man”, who was allegedly harassing customers (Lewis). This incident is part of a larger national chain of such fatal encounters with police, but in Venice, it seems that the increasing housing prices and commercial stores will serve only to attract the affluent to Venice, creating a probably scenario in which “homeless folks [will] butt up against wealthy people”. This could potentially create a cycle wherein police brutality will intensify as a means of retaliation and preserving the “safety” of Venice Beach. However, while many of these wealthy urbanites speak favorably of diversity when searching for a city to relocate to, “when they see what it means to share spaces – especially with individuals of different socioeconomic backgrounds – they become more cautious and critical”, as in the case of the backlash against the growing homeless population of Venice (Deener). As the economic demographic of the neighborhood has morphed into the crevices of upper-class privilege, the “resounding tenor of disgust, fear or frustration” further ruptures the identity of the once welcoming and relaxed beach town with discontent and stand-offish distaste. While several nonprofit organizations have attempted to alleviate the plight of the homeless by creating homeless encampments and setting up outdoor showers, opponents of such actions claim it is merely “enabling the situation” by “[creating] a community” and giving them “a place to come” (Czachor). This opposition came in the form of concrete action this summer  when Councilman Mike Bonin’s proposal for a new homeless shelter was ardently opposed by a great number of residents. With median household income in LA County at $53,482, compared to the $95,500 median household income for Venice Beach, the chasm appears to grow even wider as it would logically inferred that most wealthy beach-goers seek the privacy and cleanliness of a town like Venice, but the presence of the homeless population seemingly disrupts that (“Household Income in Venice”). However, in many instances, the homeless are not the stereotypically lazy, drug addicts who do not attempt to rectify their own dilemmas; in the case of artists like Segovia, many have chosen this “lifestyle” in the pursuit of a passion, which for him, means painting art. In an unexpectedly upbeat interview, Segovia notes that the homeless artists have their own support system, “[enhancing] each other’s experience…[because] appreciation really takes on a new meaning when you’re meeting people like this and making art” (Czachor). The sort of unbridled, open-minded perspective is the type of atmosphere that the pre-gentrification Venice promoted, the one that roaming artists from all over would come to reap creative inspiration from. 

Inevitably, with the commercial and community-based shifts occurring, the signature artistic culture on which Venice was built has also undergone alterations, stamping out the talent and contributions of those who do not meet the socioeconomic prerequisites to make a living there. In 1950s, the Beat generation consisted of young artists and poets who were averse to the ideal of suburbia and took hold in Venice Beach because of the creative spirit and inspiration they could reap from it. They chose Venice as one of the main birthplaces of the movement, in part, because it had “low rents” and “street-level tolerance” (Noonan). Throughout the last half century, numerous famous artists and musicians have hailed from Venice, setting a precedent of artistic inspiration in Venice. In the modern day, celebrities like Julia Roberts and Robert Downey Jr. still or have lived there, continuing Venice’s association as a sanctuary for the artistically creative. Despite this, the original beachtown of Venice was a place where any artist without fame to his name could seek inspiration and hence make a name for himself there, similar to the milieu of the beatniks (Creason). Nowadays, the housing prices in Venice have grown selective, leaving only the rich, the famous, and the privileged to carry on the artistic history of Venice. The possibility of an aspiring group of struggling, young artists migrating back to Venice to begin their artistic quests is rendered highly improbable; due to the gentrifying effects of commercial, cultural, and demographic shifts, Venice has become a neighborhood where only those who are already successful and established can afford to reside in. 

A career as an artist of any kind, whether it be painter or musician or woodcarver, is often perceived with discreet unapproval, skepticism, or even scorn. This may be, in large part, due to the insecurity of the income and the inconsistency of the production of their art that jeopardizes a respectable social standing, except for the few who have “made it”. Pre-gentrification Venice was intended as a sanctuary for these people, to come to a place of “laid-back surfers, a lively arts community, and gritty streets” and experience the ‘burgeoning scene of art, music and culture” (Martin). However, the reality is that the attempted beautification of Venice, inadvertently instigated by developer and artist J. Kevin Brunk beginning in the late 80s when he planted palm trees and renamed the main boulevard as “Abbot Kinney”, started to consume and erase the very thing that gave Venice its original beauty (Francis). Originally recognized as one of the most uniquely iconoclastic communities, the Venice of modern times has created a scenario in which artists like the Beat generation physically cannot live there. It is largely due to the exorbitant housing prices, which push low-income artists out of the community, leaving them no choice but to relocate to areas where rents are more affordable. However, the intrinsic reason for Venice’s unique appeal is the fact that artists of decades past had given Venice both the physical interest factor and the reputation as being an inspiration hub for artistry. It is rather ironic and counterintuitive now to see that people like Segovia, who are ardent advocates for the cathartic experience of creating and are the type of people who once made the art of Venice, are frowned upon for sleeping on the boardwalk and inhabiting the space. It would seem now that despite the supposed artistic fervor of Venice, the cold reality remains that if someone were an artist with neither prestige nor money to his name, he would be an artist essentially unwelcome in the community of Venice.

After a thorough analysis of various aspects of the transformations that Venice Beach has undergone, it can be concluded that the presence of Snapchat and other similar companies spurred commercial changes and real estate increases that altered the socioeconomic and racial demographic of Venice, and spurring tensions due to the homeless situation. It seems that the plethora of these factors, in tandem with the continued pathway of modernization and gentrification predicted for Venice’s future, have started to detract from and inhibit the continuation of the artistic culture that was responsible for Venice’s unique flair and attractiveness. Rapid gentrification, it seems, is the culprit behind the sudden shift in the very identity and composition of Venice, twisting the leisurely, iconoclastic nature of a small beach town into an intensified hub of technological innovation and commercial luxury. While it can and should be acknowledged that gentrification and the side effects it brought along are not entirely detrimental in every aspect, the reality is that the familiar core identity of Venice Beach, the original appeal that drew so many to the shoreline, is slowly becoming a thing of history. To the traditionalists, to the locals, and to the poor aspiring artists, that might be reason to complain things have “gone to shit”. But “shit” may just be a point of view, a perspective suspended in time; the future, however gentrified Venice may be, still holds unexplored possibilities, and perhaps a little open-mindedness and artistic innovation is all that is necessary to make the neighborhood as great as it once was.
