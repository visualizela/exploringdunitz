While visiting the University of Southern California (USC) for the first time, the contrast between the surrounding neighborhood and the campus shocked me. Despite hearing stories about the dilapidated nature of the area, it was unbelievable to me that such enormous disparities in socio-economic status could occur within a mere two blocks of each other. It eventually became evident that the process by which racial tension and the constant threat of gentrification shape social change is integral to understanding the struggle of minorities and the poverty stricken in South Central Los Angeles. Residual tension from the Jim Crow Era and a confrontational relationship between law enforcement and minority communities exploded into racially charged riots that threatened to rip the area apart. Additionally, looming gentrification has and will continue to impact a community disproportionately afflicted with higher rates of poverty and plagued by lower rates of education. It has been the goal of numerous organizations to mitigate the effects that the aforementioned issues have on the residents of the region. 

Many artists aim to bring awareness to important social issues through their work. In South Central, artist Noni Olabisi painted To Protect and Serve, a mural encapsulating the history of the Black Panther Party (BPP), an organization founded to end violence against blacks. The mural was dedicated to civil rights lawyers, social workers, freedom fighters, political prisoners and those who lost their lives in the pursuit of justice (Olabisi 2). Depicting the lynchings of the Jim Crow era, the drive towards civil rights, and the height of the organization, Olabisi argues that the BPP was a benevolent organization that was able to bring peace and prosperity to blacks.

Next to the man being hogtied and the man being lynched by the Ku Klux Klan sits a bound and gagged Bobby Seale, co-founder of the BPP. This references the Chicago Seven Trial where he was removed from court and sentenced by judge Julius Hoffman to an unreasonable four years in prison for contempt of court. The judge’s blindfold symbolizes that miscarriage of justice, one of many in the bigoted history of black fear and pain in the United States (see fig. 1).

In the midst of the crowd stands a stoic Huey Newton, BPP co-founder, and a regal Angela Davis, political activist. The somberness on their faces represents the uncertain times of the Civil Rights era where opposition to racial equality was intense and law enforcement could not be relied upon to protect protestors. In the face of these overwhelming odds, the BPP remained staunch in their defense of blacks and their rights. Young and old, they marched together to protest unbearable injustice. The oversized clothes worn by the dejected boy indicate that he lived during a time that forced him to grow up too quickly and assume the responsibilities of a mature man at an abnormally young age (see fig. 2). Despite Olabisi’s best intentions, the mural was rejected three times by the city council before being approved in a close vote (Von Blum 85). That the mural faced such staunch opposition indicates that many held onto the agitator stereotype of the BPP and were oblivious to its socially conscious aspects. Much like the relationship between these disapproving council members and Olabisi, the dynamic between minorities and law enforcement was often fraught with discord.                                                                                      
 
From Chief William Parker’s controversial career with the Los Angeles Police Department  to the FBI’s takedown of the Los Angeles BPP, law enforcement has always been an adversarial figure in South Central. Blacks continued to be treated as second class citizens despite the widespread success of the Civil Rights movement. The plight of minorities worsened during the career of Chief Parker. In the 1950’s, Parker proliferated the practice of racial profiling (Sonksen). By ratcheting up the racial tension in the communities he was supposed to serve, Parker indelibly seeded mistrust within the minority population. In 1968, a different law enforcement agency was alarmed by the radical viewpoints of the BPP; the FBI caused the assassinations of the two most important Los Angeles BPP leaders, Bunchy Carter and John Huggins (Bloom). With the loss of resources and leadership, the free programs that once benefited destitute residents soon ceased to exist. Exacerbated by mistrust of law enforcement, racial unrest would translate into some of the worst riots in history. 
                                                                                          
Racial tensions, boiling from centuries of slavery, lynchings, and police brutality, would soon reach a breaking point. In South Central, a major contributing factor to rioting was the sense of helplessness that black communities were struggling to express. In 1965, while Marquette Frye was being detained for drunk driving, a crowd mobbed the police officers involved. The ensuing riots left thirty-four dead, more than a thousand wounded, and forty million dollars in damage (Appendix A). That the rioters swarmed law enforcement so rapidly is a testament to their disapproval of Chief Parker’s racist policies. In the decades it took for South Central to recover from the Watts Riot, black unemployment hit an all time low and the crack epidemic swept through Los Angeles. In 1992, after four cops were exonerated from beating  unarmed motorist Rodney King bloody, another riot swept through the area leaving sixty-three dead, two-thousand injured, and one billion dollars in damage (Appendix A). With Hispanics joining the 1992 Rodney King Riots, the future of the community would be significantly altered. High levels of racial tension among increasingly diverse groups of residents meant that South Central was poised to enter into a new realm of issues. 

To comprehend the impact that gentrification has on South Central, the racial composition and socio-economic mobility of the area needs to be considered. After the banning of racial discrimination in the defense industry during World War Two (WWII), the ethnic diversity of the neighborhood surged with its population. Today, South Central’s racial composition is 74% hispanic, 25% black, and 1% white (Appendix B). Hispanics, who streamed into the community during the war and would outnumber blacks by the 1980’s, began to feel the adverse effects of poverty, neglect, and police brutality. Their frustrations, mirrored by those of their black brothers and sisters, led to unity between the two groups in the mayhem and chaos that was the 1992 Rodney King Riots. Only 6.6% of South Central residents have a bachelor’s degree, a third of the population lives below the poverty line, and a mere 8.7% were able to move to a different city this past year (Appendix B). As education is essential to socio-economic mobility, it is difficult for the uneducated to move to a more prosperous region. The inability of residents to voluntarily move means that gentrification will force them from the only place they can call home; this issue has been a long standing one. 

Gentrification and redlining have been destroying the legacy of South Central, formerly a prosperous black neighborhood where the African American population doubled every decade from 1900-1940 (Sonksen). Despite WWII anti-discrimination ordinances, which opened up thousands of jobs to minorities, redlining, the practice of denying housing primarily on the basis of race, forced those minority workers to settle in South Central almost completely segregating Los Angeles neighborhoods by socio-economic status. Overcrowding in that area led to progressively worsening living conditions for those workers. One of the worst cases of gentrification occurred with the 1960’s construction of the I-10 interstate. The highway cut through the South Central neighborhood of Sugar Hill destroying hundreds of houses (Sonksen). The decision by the Los Angeles City Council to approve the highway was not a purely economic issue. Jealous and fearful of that successful minority community, the council welcomed the opportunity to destroy their homes. This pervasive issue continues to affect the area to this day through new developments.

Unfortunately, gentrification in South Central is worsening. The problem manifests itself in the form of metro renovations, property development, and unchecked rent raises. The recent arrival of the Rams football team necessitates the expansion of the metro transportation system. Just north, USC recently invested $700 million into a campus expansion (Sonksen). As the metro line slithers towards already sparse residential areas, residents are pushed further away from their homes. The rising prices in new stores and restaurants in and around USC constitute only a fraction of the costs residents bear. Increasing property values and decreasing construction space cause rent to skyrocket in the neighborhood. In 2017, the median monthly rent for a one bedroom apartment in South Central was nearly $2000 (Sonksen). For residents living off of $1000 social security checks and $200 food stamps, these rent increases leave many penniless if not homeless. The expanding trajectory of urban development means other residents will lose their homes forever. Though the gentrification situation remains dire, numerous local organizations drive or have driven social change.

Historically, despite its militant connotations, the BPP was a benevolent organization whose purpose was to aid blacks and the poor. Although it is no more, the organization operated diverse programs ranging from free food to free healthcare during its peak years. In 1968, the BPP started its free breakfast program (see fig. 3). By 1969, it was providing a complimentary morning meal to thousands of people across nineteen American cities including South Central (Chiles). The exponential expansion of the free breakfast program speaks to efficacy of the BPP. Considering that it was the organization’s first foray into major relief programs, the rapid success was even more incredible. Another BPP program was the People’s Free Medical Clinics which provided disease testing, vaccines, and physicals for those in South Central and twelve other American cities (Chiles). The impact of the program was tremendous as it brought international attention to Sickle Cell Disorder while also providing a launchpad for many future black doctors. The BPP’s legacy of social change has undoubtedly inspired many today.

Non-profit organizations across South Central affect significant social change. From 
mitigating racial tensions to staving off gentrification, numerous groups seek to rectify centuries of injustice. The South Central Dreamers (SCD) recruit youth activists who are educated on important issues like racism and gentrification. Another group, Strategic Actions for a Just Community (SAJE) provides social justice and civil rights internships to deserving minority youth (Sonksen). By providing education that instills a sense of justice and opportunities that foster potential for tangible change, the SCD and the SAJE are paving the way for a brighter future in their neighborhoods. Nearby, USC alumna Vanessa Luna works with nonprofit Clifford Beers Housing to construct affordable homes for South Central residents (Oganesyan 1). Luna’s education at a prestigious college, which happens to be situated in the source of the issue, indicates that she has the ethos to help fight gentrification in the area. Non-profits are not the only groups that are attempting to help out the underserved.

There are profit-based entities in South Central that look out for the needy. With the dearth of affordable grocery stores and lack of quality hospitals in the neighborhood, residents are forced to subsist off unhealthy foods and pray for good health. Fortunately, Everytable, and USC’s Keck School of Medicine exist to mitigate these issues. The mission of Everytable, a restaurant chain, is to provide underserved communities with cheap nutritious meals. Prices vary according to the socio-economic condition of the neighborhood (Harris). Feeding countless hungry mouths with its recent rapid expansion of multiple new stores this year, the company’s business model appears to be working. When medical emergencies arise, South Central residents often find that the nearest hospitals are too far away or too expensive. For these people, the USC Keck School of Medicine provides top notch medical care at an affordable price (Xavier). Keck outshines other South Central hospitals in that it prioritizes getting impoverished patients back on their feet over the bottom line. If poverty is ever eradicated from South Central, organizations like Everytable and USC Keck should be celebrated for their efforts.  

Rife with hatred and prejudice, the legacy of pre-civil rights America pushed minorities to revolt against what they believed was an unjust system. It is no wonder that lower levels of educational attainment and higher levels of poverty in South Central created an environment that has and is forcing residents out in the name of luxury and urban development. These issues are being tackled by an array of organizations that aim to affect social change. With that in mind, both racial violence and looming gentrification are necessary to understand what the underserved in South Central have and will continue to face on a daily basis. After matriculating at USC, a mere two months was all it took for me to firmly grasp the causes behind the asymmetry of my school and South Central, the school of hard knocks. If only the issues perpetuating inequality in the neighborhood could be solved in such a short period of time.
