runningtitle: "What is Koreatown?"
---
   Imagine at the age of sixteen, instead of doing well in school and socializing, being sequestered into a brothel, forced to repeatedly service men invading your country with no reprieve. Imagine the long lasting pain of  being forced into sexual servitude with no breaks and ability to defend yourself. Imagine having zero power, as a foreign entity comes and pillages your nation for years on end. The kinds of scars this atrocity would leave on people is not something that fades quickly, and to this day is still fresh in the minds of Koreans that were forced to endure. To make matters worse, there was almost no time to heal and rebuild as a the war for communism and freedom set its sights on the Korean Peninsula, disrupting the nation’s ecosystem once again. A lack of more positive interactions with foreign powers developed a strong sense of nationalism within many Koreans, including many who immigrated to the United States. In the past, Koreatown has been a very fragmented and racially divided area, with Koreans only putting each other on equal footing: a view illustrated by the artwork within the area in the early 90s. 
   
   The Koreatown of today, however, is a modern hub that has undergone a radical change that is the result of a multitude of factors. Chief among these factors are the changing urban landscape that is being guided by an increase in demand for residential and commercial real estate, the exodus of the more prosperous Korean-Americans due to the “American Dream” who are now being replaced with an influx of millennials looking for Koreatown’s gentler urban scene, and the diffusion of Korean culture that has begun to draw more and more people of different backgrounds and cultures to Koreatown. 
   
   The presence of Korean-Americans was once that of a proud and exclusive group. With the memory of Japanese internment, the Korean War, and migrational restrictions by the US fresh in their minds, ethnic homogeneity was one truth that many Korean immigrants held closely to their hearts as they began to build better lives for themselves and their posterity. The co-mingling of other nationalities at the same level of respect in a social setting was discouraged as Koreans’ trust for any ethnicity that was not their own had vanished. In the 1900’s, there were many murals commissioned to liven up the city that had just been torn down by the Rodney King Riots. There are two murals, one illustrated by a Japanese-American and Chinese American, the other created by a Korean American, whose comparison reveals quite a bit about the Korean mindset in the past and provides context for the change that has been going on in recent years.
   
   The first mural, Remember Your Roots (shown below) was created by Tony Osumi and Darryl Mar in 1994. The two were UCLA graduates studying Asian American studies and were tasked with envisioning the soul of Koreatown within a mural, though they had had little contact with Koreatown prior to the commission. Originally, they planned to focus solely on the heritage of Koreans, but upon interaction with the community, they found a much more diverse narrative where Korean-American children openly played with Latino-American and African-American children. Seeing this, “they discovered that Koreatown isn't just for Korean Americans” (“Koreatown: Mural Evolves Into a Neighborly Project). Osumi and Mar’s realization led to the creation of a mural that incorporated the inspiration of Korean heritage along with the true representation of the community.
   
   The second mural, Korean Farmers Dance (no available picture: Warrior by Dong In Park was included to depict the ethnic exclusivity very similar to that in Korean Farmers Dance) was illustrated by Dong In Park, a Korean-American native to the community. His mural depicted eight traditionally dressed Korean farmers preparing for an arduous harvest. Dong’s work was created to remind Koreans that they must look to their roots and be like their ancestors: strong survivors. Park said he didn’t “want the 1.5- and second-generation Korean kids to forget their language and history” (“Koreatown: Artist Completes His Mural of Hope”). Though his intentions seemed good and pure, the deliberate exclusion of others heavily involved in the community speaks volumes about the attitude of Korean-Americans living in the area who would condone and foster this kind of narrow-minded thinking. These two different views depict the more stubborn history of Koreatown, revealing that those Korean-Americans native to Koreatown only think of their own ethnicity when creating something for the community. There had always been a clear divide with Koreans when interacting with other races, yet in recent years this mindset has begun to change.
   
   Koreatown’s changing urban landscape and recent diversification can be attributed in large part to the residential real estate market which is being commanded by millennials who are demanding affordable housing that also has alluring amenities: all of which can be found in Koreatown. Koreatown is becoming a residential hotspot and has begun to introduce new elements into Koreatown’s racial dynamics. According to the Commercial Observer and Dale Yonkin, an executive at Nadel Architects who works heavily in the area, Koreatown is a strong, centralized market that has the capabilities to grow even more due to its affordability and great amenities. With many of those in the market for urban condos or apartments, there has been a large spike in demand for areas like Koreatown that offer modern housing in an urban setting that is not directly in the heart of Downtown Los Angeles. Dale Yonkin believes the demand for living in such an area as Koreatown is “driven by basically people who are looking for a kinder and gentler downtown [...] it’s a little less urban and yet it has a lot of the same amenities. It’s probably one of the strongest restaurant areas in L.A. and it has very walkable streets and will become more so as the density increases” (LA’s Koreatown is Boomtown for Real Estate Development”). With such a demand alive, developers are devising new and creative ways to cater towards this market. 
   
   All together, developers have created over three thousand units of housing in the past two years and plans are already under way for five thousand units to be created. The effects of such a massive amount of development being catered to younger generations have already begun to show to the natives. Keum Rin-Baik, one such native who has lived in the community since 1976, has commented on how much Koreatown has changed, saying that “ten years ago, non-Koreans made up 10% of [his] customers [at Kobawoo]. Now, it’s more like 30%. It’s the hallyu—Korean culture is popular now” (“The Changing Face of Koreatown” Steph Cha). More and more Koreatown finds itself changing as the demand for its residences shows no sign of slowing. In this year alone, LA Curbed predicts the development of over thirty residential/mixed-use projects. Major streets like Wilshire and Vermont find themselves being flooded with projects as companies like Jamison Services seem “to be on a mission to singlehandedly reinvent the neighborhood” (“52 projects taking over Koreatown”). Though Koreatown’s recent growth in real estate contributes a large part to the changing neighborhood, there is a cultural factor that adds many elements to the Koreatown of tomorrow.
   
   Due to the “American Dream,” there is a noticeable exodus out of Koreatown in those who attain greater socio-economic status. The goal for many Koreans hailing from the home country was the same goal as every other immigrant: to be more successful and live better lives than the ones they left behind. To so many like elders, including those in my own family, who immigrated from Korea in the 70s, being able to live with greater socio-economic means in the “true” America was the end all be all. “To Koreans or Korean-Americans, Koreatown is something temporary” (Boo Eung Koh, 55). Rather than being a place that many wanted to spend their entire lives in, “Koreatown is a [temporary] comforting place in that [immigrants] do not have to face any language and cultural barriers in their new American life” (Boo Eung Koh, 56). They utilized this familiar background as a fallback point in case assimilation became too difficult; “however, Korean-Americans who [...] succeeded in culturally assimilating to American life in business or career tr[ied] to escape Koreantown by moving to more prestigious residential areas such as Santa Monica or Irvine” (Boo Eung Koh, 56). Koreatown’s prominence to Koreans has begun to falter as it becomes less and less Korean with the rise of more Americanized generations. Now, only “one-third of the people living there are actually descendants of Korean immigrants now” (“The Changing Face of Koreatown” Karen Jordan). This gap that has been created now continues to fuel the inundation of millennials into Koreatown’s culture.
   
   Millennials have come to flood the Koreatown corridor for two reasons: affordability and amenities. Such a large amount of millennials flocking to Koreatown has slowly started to reshape it. Los Angeles is one of the most expensive cities in the world to live in. Overpopulation coupled with archaic land use laws has caused the outrageous prices the come about. For many millennials working in the city who have not established a solid financial base, Koreatown’s much cheaper pricing and close proximity to the city is extremely alluring. According to Dale Yonkin “rents in the historic core of Downtown L.A. hover at $4.50 per square foot, while in Koreatown they are around $3 per square foot” (“LA’s Koreatown is Boomtown for Real Estate Development”). With a thirty three percent difference, the obvious choice for many millennials has been to move to areas like Koreatown. With an abundance of amenities related to food, retail, and transportation, the strength of Koreatown’s residential market will continue to rise. Armed with this knowledge, many commercial real estate developers have gravitated towards models that interests millennials, creating more and more mixed-use properties, around twenty four out of fifty two proposed projects according to Curbed LA, that ties together affordable housing along with retail amenities. 
   
   Not only have mixed-use buildings been in high demand, but Koreatown’s historic buildings are being refurbished with modern interiors and have become very popular among millennials. The area is rife with older buildings that have fallen into disrepair and it is through developers like Anthony Bernal, the president of the Bernal Capital Group which works heavily in Koreatown, that these buildings are beginning to see a fresh start, giving Koreatown a new look and culture. According to Bernal, many potential residents that are in the millennial range “are attracted to the character of the older buildings and not worried about the lack of parking since [many] take Uber and local transit” (“The Changing Face of Koreatown” Karen Jordan). Millennials demands are driving a change in Koreatown’s complexion, where a combination of new developments and a revival of older structures has begun to reshape Koreatown as it becomes a more and more attractive scene. Though business is driving a lot of change, there are social phenomenons pertaining to Korean culture that has also fueled change within the city. 
   
   “Hallyu,” or the the Korean Wave, has begun to crash down over the world and is contributing in large part to the reshaping of Koreatown’s climate and culture. The widespread love for Korean pop culture has resulted in Koreatown becoming a more iconic place and has changed its environment quite a bit. In recent years, the world has seen the phenomenon of “Hallyu.” “Hallyu” is a romanized version of “Hanryu,” a South Korean term which when translated into English means “flow” or “wave,” and it refers to the diffusion of Korean culture worldwide. With the rise of pop hits like “Gangnam Style” by Psy and “DNA” by BTS and the increasing popularity of Korean skincare regimens, Korean culture has become a global phenomenon. The culture now commands such attention that “during the Olympic opening ceremonies on February 9, 2018, athletes marched in the Parade of Nations to the accompaniment of a select group of K-pop hits, each playing into the image South Korea wants to present right now: one of a country that’s a fully integrated part of the global culture” (“How K-pop became a global phenomenon”). 
   
   To put the recent love for Korean culture into perspective, a grouping of large events in multiple pertaining to Korean culture, KCON, started in 2012 with just one small event in Irvine, California. Over the years, as Korean culture and KCON have spread hand in hand. From a small event an hour away from Los Angeles, KCON has expanded to majors cities like LA, Paris, Mexico City, Abu Dhabi, Tokyo, and so many more. In just August of 2016, “KCON LA drew more than 85,000 fans,” a major display revealing how large Korean culture has grown in prominence (“Korean wave makes a splash worldwide”). Korean culture has truly begun to make waves in the world and aids in making inroads for diversification in Koreatown. People do not want to live in an area that is unfamiliar to them. When someone thinks of home, they naturally think of comfort. A home cannot be comfortable in a totally foreign and unaccepting environment. While Koreatown was once that, it is now a more familiar place that people wish to live in. On top of the desirable prices and accommodations, the more diverse and accepting environment, the love for Korean culture, the recent culinary changes within Koreatown are stamping it as a more open and less discriminatory area. 
   
   Throughout the history of Korean-Americans, food establishments were insulated and cultivated into environments that welcomed only Koreans; but in recent years, the ways in which Korean food is created and presented has been experimented with such that it reaches a much broader audience. LA’s diverse food scene draws in bold and delicious dishes from around the world. Culinary delights from all over like pho, curry, sushi, bratwurst, and so much more have found their way to Los Angeles. The instant that many of these dishes found their way here were adapted and altered to fit the American palate. Those like the Thai and Chinese wanted to “create a bulletproof dish that chefs and restaurateurs knew would appeal to the masses” (“How Korean Cuisine Got Huge in America (And Why It Took So Long)”).  To fit this mold, Thai and Chinese chefs paired complementary elements of their native foods to American cuisine. 
   
   Unlike the Thai or Chinese, when they initially came to the States, Koreans decided that they didn’t want a pad Thai or an orange chicken. The cuisine was taken directly from the kitchens in Korea and implemented in the US with no change. To most Korean restaurateurs, this was fine as “Korean restaurants, at first, were more of a clubby environment, for Koreans, by Koreans” (“How Korean Cuisine Got Huge in American (And Why It Took So Long)”). Slowly though, with the creation of bulgogi tacos, the fusion of staple dishes like kimchi into other dishes, and the phenom of cheap Korean barbecue has led to a craze with all people, of all ethnicities. Now “Twitter-literate residents soak up beers at pubs like DwitGolMok, or sip cocktails at Roy Choi’s new rooftop Commissary; emerging restaurants like Saint Martha don’t require grilling meats over an open flame; hipsters are spotted in every barbecue joint” (“The Changing Face of Koreatown” Steph Cha). No longer is Koreatown a “club for Koreans by Koreans,” but is instead a diverse amalgamation of people whose races and backgrounds contribute to a greater picture, not dissimilar to that of Osumi and Mar’s mural, Remember Your Roots.
   
   Koreatown’s new image can be attributed in large part to the exodus of Korean-Americans that has led to an influx of the millennial generation, whose demands for affordable, desirable housing and amenities has reshaped Koreatown. Prior to the late 1990s, Koreatown was a totally unwelcoming city tailored strictly for Koreans. Now though, the combination of new real estate, the changing racial dynamics, the spreading “hallyu,” and the adapted Korean cuisine, Koreatown finds itself diversifying more and more. With so much change coming about, what does the future hold? Where will Koreatown find itself in the next decade? Only time will tell.
