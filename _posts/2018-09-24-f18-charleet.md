   In changing regional atmosphere, the Korean population in Southern California faces threats to its cultural presence. Los Angeles, though an important center for both Asian-Americans and Latino immigrants, faces gentrification and change throughout the wide city and its neighborhoods. For years, the Korean population was not large enough in Southern California to create a Korean cultural hub, so many Koreans lived near each other due to proximity with local churches. Since expanded growth in the 1980s, Koreatown has been an essential center for Koreans in California, particularly those living near Los Angeles. Koreatown’s cultural importance throughout its history stems from its entrepreneurial business atmosphere and diverse cultural and social opportunities to support the immigrant population in assimilation. Most of the earlier Korean immigrants came to the United States to find economic opportunity, often working laborious jobs. The local ethnic community in Koreatown promotes Korean entrepreneurs and new business in that sect of Los Angeles. Along with promising Korean business potential, the neighborhood also incorporated social and cultural options to encourage inclusion, such as church groups and ethnicity-specific organizations. Though the business and social opportunities often go hand-in-hand in facilitating a strong Korean community, each is important in ensuring the success of Korean immigrants in Southern California. 
 
   When Koreans migrate to the United States, it can be difficult to find employment due to language barriers, cultural differences, or unrealistic expectations, but Koreatown provides a place where Koreans can easily find employment. As Koreans moved into central Los Angeles in the early part of the 20th century, there was a focus on maintaining a semblance of home in the growing metropolis. Many Koreans moved around the neighborhood of the University of Southern California, finding affinity and community in local church groups. But, as the population grew, there was pressure to find affordable housing for immigrants. According to Myung, “Korean immigrants operated their own business by settling in old vacant buildings. In this way, the area along Olympic Boulevard gradually became the center of Korean business” (2015). Rising from the ashes of abandoned buildings, the Korean economy gave way to a new epicenter for Korean business in Southern California. Soon, entire strip malls would be turned to Korean newspapers, radio stations, grocery stores, and other necessities for a thriving society. In this way, Koreans began to truly find their footing in a neighborhood through economic ties. This new economy, formed almost entirely of one ethnicity, is often referred to as an enclave economy. For many Koreans, the enclave economy that was created is important in building their economic standing in the United States. The enclave economy creates a sort of incubator for “ethnic entrepreneurship,” which “creates job opportunities for the self-employed as well as for ethnic workers who would otherwise be excluded by the mainstream labor market” (Zhou 2010). For immigrants or those who are relatively new to American culture or the English language, having such an enclave is crucial to success; without financial options, many would end up on the streets, worse off than even their most modest aspirations. Further, as Lee notes, “ethnic neighborhoods facilitate positive business environments for ethnic small firms” (1995). Since people, in general, are most comfortable in familiar surroundings, Koreans are encouraged to support the local small businesses run by other Koreans, creating a positive atmosphere for up and coming Korean business ventures.	
	
   Through these prosperous and available business ventures for Korean immigrants, the population is brought closer together to strengthen the bonds with fellow Koreans. As the economic enclave began to form in Koreatown, so was the identity of the neighborhood shaped. The new businesses eventually attracted a wave of Korean investment in the new neighborhood, which “served a vital role in creating a newfound sense of community cohesion and identity” (Park). Soon after the economic enclave is well-established, many Koreans begin eating and shopping in the same stores, restaurants, and grocery stores. This, in turn, created a sense of home in a foreign place for many of the immigrants that traveled across the Pacific Ocean to Southern California. Next, entrepreneurial business in Koreatown and similar economic enclaves creates a cycle of entrepreneurship with new Korean immigrants. In Zhou’s “A Focused Look at the Chinese and Korean Enclave Economies in Los Angeles,” she says, “ethnic entrepreneurship not only fosters the entrepreneurial spirit and sets up role models among co-ethnic members, but also trains prospective entrepreneurs.” The role models that surround and welcome new-comers to Koreatown are important in ensuring the continued success of the entrepreneurial spirit in Koreatown. Each generation that learns from each other strengthens bonds within the community, no matter their decision to remain in the neighborhood or move elsewhere. 
	
   The connections formed through this economic enclave give more opportunity for religion to become more involved in the community and further strengthen the Korean population in Koreatown. As previously mentioned, the churches around the University of Southern California played a critical part of the old Koreatown’s formation, when the Korean population was not nearly as large as it is today. The immigrants, many of whom were religious, grew their social network through the spiritual life around them, which motivated many to move to South Central Los Angeles. As the hub for Koreans shifted further north to where it is today, there was a shift in how religion played a part in the life in many Koreans. As we learned from our Uber driver, a young recent Korean immigrant and a resident in Koreatown, religion is no longer an integral part of the society in Koreatown as it once was. Still, church groups have been instrumental for some in creating social bonds and a community for Koreans. In fact, “data reveals that Korean congregations play a pivotal role in creating social capital for the Korean immigrant community in Los Angeles: many Koreans have built close social networks through the ethnic churches” (Choi 2004). Church groups and congregations still play a role in the development and preservation of the identity in Koreatown. At the same time, as our Uber driver mentioned, the role of religion has shifted since the community migrated further North. Religion has also played secondary roles in supporting other pillars of the Korean community, such as the entrepreneurial spirit and economic prosperity. According to Choi, “Korean churches act as small business incubators in Koreatown, placing information and financial capital within the reach of immigrant entrepreneurs” (2004). Through church groups, Korean immigrants find a place within the community and are then able to establish themselves economically. Through church funding, entrepreneurs have increased chances of being prosperous and staying in the neighborhood. In this way, Koreans are maintaining better inter-communal relations though church groups that are supporting other aspects of daily life. 
	
   Similar to how church groups help support the development of Koreatown, the education system supports a non-English speaking population as well as gives opportunities for entrepreneurs to connect with the future residents of Koreatown. To supplement the education that students receive in school, Koreans send their children to after-school and extracurricular programs that are often tied to local businesspeople and Korean culture. According to Zhou, these unconventional educational services are typically “not visible in conventional ethnic entrepreneurship, but they nonetheless open up a unique opportunity for prospective immigrant entrepreneurs, especially those who are highly educated but lack proficient English-language ability,” and she later notes that “in the past two decades, the proliferation of private institutions serving youth is increasingly noticeable in the Korean immigrant communities in Los Angeles.” In fact, “the levels of diversity and density of private institutions serving children or youth are exceptionally high in Koreatown” (2010). Entrepreneurs have taken it upon themselves to introduce additional schooling and activities to local children. For these entrepreneurs, it provides another way in which they can connect with the youth of the neighborhood and further grow the identity of the neighborhood’s future. Some of the examples of activities set up for the youth include “early childhood educational programs, college preparatory centers, and cram schools, as well as music, dance, and arts studios and karate, kung fu, and other sports clubs” (Zhou 2010). For parents as well as other members of the community, it is reassuring that their kids are being taught some of the similar educational principles and activities that have been passed down for generations. The culture that they have grown up around is being passed down and maintained in Southern California. At the same time, these institutions are merely supplementary to the schooling being taught in the public schools in the area, which many of the Korean students attend. The private institutions formed by local entrepreneurs “combine with the local nonprofits to form an elaborate ethnic system of supplementary education” (Zhou 2010). The ethnic-based education system set up by the locals paves the way for students to receive an education reminiscent of the schooling of their Korean relatives as well as gain a perspective of the American education system. Moreover, the youth have been integrated by receiving educational aspects of their Korean predecessors as well as from the Americans with which they are being integrated. This allows for future generations to have a multi-perspective view of their community as well as the greater Southern California region.

   Though these days the community is rife with Hispanics and ethnicities other than Korean, the substantial investment from Koreans in the economic enclave and social systems will ensure that the identity and spirit of Koreatown will carry on. Earlier this year, the city of Los Angeles proposed to introduce a homeless shelter in the middle of the central economic corridor of Koreatown, on Vermont Avenue. The plan drew extensive criticism from the Korean constituency as they believed it could dilute the neighborhood’s character and ethnic makeup. Worth noting, however, is the widespread criticism it drew from people all around Southern California, some who, it would seem, have little or no connection to Koreatown. Recently, many Koreans came from across the region to support protests against the proposed shelter. In a Los Angeles Times article, a man drove 90 miles from his home in Victorville, where he has lived and worked for a decade, to protest in Koreatown. The only caveat, however, was that he had never even lived there. To defend his three-hour drive each way, he says that he did it to “have his say in Koreatown: Koreatown is where we all got our start […] all Koreans, even if they don’t live in Koreatown, need to participate” in the protest (Kim 2018). He was not alone; according to Kim “a large number of those who demonstrated, donated money to pay for ads or crowded City Hall chambers were Korean Americans who did not live or work in the neighborhood.” Others feel similarly. A man who moved out of Koreatown at four years old says he “still feels invested in the community.” Koreatown has always been “something of a mecca where friends and family regularly convene to eat, grocery shop or attend church” (Kim 2018). For many, Koreatown is no longer the only place where Koreans live in Southern California, as it once was, but instead has transformed into its center: the place that Korean-Americans can point to as their home, though never having lived there.

   As we learned from a local we spoke to in Koreatown, the neighborhood has transformed into the gateway to the United States for Korean immigrants. When we hopped into our Uber to take us across Koreatown, we did not expect to have a meaningful conversation about our driver’s heritage and his views of the transforming Koreatown. As we began conversing, we asked him about the construction projects going on in the neighborhood, something we noticed was much more prevalent there than other neighborhoods. Eventually, he spoke about how the change is sparked by the younger immigrants coming into the community. He told us that most of the wealthier and older Koreans had already moved out to the suburbs, such as Glendale or the San Fernando Valley. From what he could tell us, the more impoverished immigrants stay in Koreatown to build themselves economically with the goal of eventually building enough wealth to move out to better neighborhoods. He joked that Koreatown was for the “poor Koreans,” though noting that he still lived there, mocking himself a bit. Yu concurs, saying “Koreans in Koreatown can legitimately be defined as a socioeconomic buffer, or a middle man between the more affluent mainstream and those immigrants still in the process of claiming a stake in society” (2004). Koreatown is by no means considered a bad place to live, though Koreans have preferred to live elsewhere once they have adjusted to the new society and obtained sustainable wealth for themselves. 
	
   While Koreatown is an integral part of the Korean community in the United States, its purpose has changed since its informal creation in the mid 20th century. Initially set up as a community formed by various church groups and congregations, it has since shifted to a more economic-based neighborhood since its shift further north to its current location. When first designated as Koreatown in 1980, it was due to the high density and volume of Korean-owned and operated businesses in the area. The enclave economy brought forth gave opportunities for Koreans to feel included and comfortable in their new surroundings, a luxury in Los Angeles’ bustling metropolis. The streets are lined with Korean signage and Korean restaurants, grocery stores, media offices, and a litany of other businesses. The atmosphere in Koreatown was for the purpose of aided assimilation; there is a sense of Korea in an otherwise diverse territory. As the economic enclave grew, so did other fundamental parts of society. Entrepreneurs had the opportunities and guidance necessary for their success in a country where many do not speak English. They received mentorship from former businesspeople in the neighborhood that could empathize with their situation, and they had greater chances to be hired when otherwise unable to find work. As more settlers came to the neighborhood and the economy grew likewise, social systems had to grow as well. Church groups became more involved in the economy of Koreatown as well as continued to provide social opportunities for the residents. In addition, the education system also changed with the community. Entrepreneurs, seeking to bring more of a Korean education to the community, created schooling and extracurricular opportunities for the youth of the neighborhood to have a better connection to Korea. The combination of these essential pillars of society has made Koreatown a significant part of the lives of Koreans in the United States, no matter whether they have even lived there. The economic opportunities and social systems of Koreatown have made it a culturally significant community to the Korean population in the United States. As the neighborhood progresses, the future of the Korean community in Southern California will surely shift, but Koreatown as its home seems inevitable.
