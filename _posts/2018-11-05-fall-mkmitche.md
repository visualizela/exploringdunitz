It is sometimes hard to believe that LA’s aesthetically pleasing and fashionable Arts District was once a place of hardship, violence, and separation from civilization. What used to be functional warehouses are now disguised with bright and colorful murals that sometimes reflect a critique on society, but also manage to attract people who seek the trendy and ideal instagram feed. The abundance of trendy and overpriced eateries and boutique shops superficially suggests that LA’s Arts District has always been this vibrant. The street art found in Downtown LA’s Arts District is reflective of the community’s ideals and demographics at the time they were created, and also serves as a source of collective identity. As a result, the overall changing aesthetic of the murals parallels and is directly related to the changing atmosphere and demographic of the Arts District. This is due to the recent influx of hip millennials, and is reflective of the gradual process of gentrification in the area. While the gentrification may bring a new crowd to the area, it simultaneously poses a threat to maintaining the authentic identity and historical significance of the Arts District.

In today’s version of the Arts District, it is evident that some of the historic and authentic traits or pillars of the neighborhood are still visible, but have modernized drastically since the era of its industrial peak in the mid twentieth century. In the mid 1800s, the Arts District was known for its vast landscape and warm climate that was perfectly suited for supporting a multiplicity of vineyards, which were soon replaced by various citrus fruits such as oranges and grapefruits that became the center of the Arts District’s commercial industry. The growth of the produce industry required the need for a railroad system “to serve the citrus industry’s shipping needs, and later to support the large number of people moving into California” (Los Angeles Conservancy, 2). Like in many areas during the Industrial Revolution, the expansion of the railroad into the Arts District transformed the landscape and the culture into a working-class commercial haven. With the transportation infrastructure already in place, the early twentieth century transition from the Arts District’s agricultural industry into a center for industrial warehouses and production centers was a fairly easy one. Gradually, however, the trucking industry took over as the primary shipping method due to its lower costs and higher accessibility and flexibility. Because the Arts District’s roads were initially built for the narrow and constantly bending railroad tracks, the use of the vehicular transportation method proved to be largely ineffective and inefficient. The area also had a limited amount of land that was not large enough to support the booming economy that took off with the Industrial Revolution. Consequently, many factories and companies left their warehouses abandoned and empty in favor of newer commercial cities that could support their production needs. The then-abandoned warehouses were a perfect fit for aspiring artists to occupy in the 1970s as live-work spaces - albeit illegally. These artists created and built the foundation for a community that is heavily directly identified with the production and acceptance of world-class street art. This illegal immigration of artists from surrounding Los Angeles communities therefore marked the birth of the community that we now effectively deem as the Arts District.

Perhaps the best evidence for the current changes affecting the Arts District can be seen through a set of selective data that describes the new residents’ backgrounds, especially that of their increasingly homogenous socioeconomic information. Though there is no available census data that specifically describes the residents of the Arts District exclusive of standard Downtown LA data from the 1970s until recently, the mere fact that the artists were being priced out of “artsy” areas such as Venice and Hollywood suggests that their overall income statistics were relatively low (Los Angeles Conservancy, 3). With the increasing popularity of the Arts District as a residential community, including the building of a few luxury condominium projects, there is now more data to express the gentrification that swallows the Arts District. Regeneration and Networks in the Arts District (Los Angeles): Rethinking Governance Models in the Production of Urbanity by Sebastien Darchen states that, “To contextualise the Arts District in Los Angeles, it had approximately 2600 residents in 2012: 77% are Caucasian and 88% have a Bachelor’s Degree and higher (Downtown LA Arts District BID, 2012: 6). The average income in 2012 was US$126,300 which is higher than the median income for the whole Downtown Los Angeles (US$99,000)” (Darchen, 3622). Because this data is suggestive of the 2012 Arts District community, it may not accurately represent the current residents.

However, the observation that residents of the Arts District earn over US$25,000 per year more than their Downtown LA counterparts, which is almost a 28% median income increase, numerically reflects the changing face of the community and the neighborhood’s gradual experience of gentrification. Especially when considering the median income of the original residents and artists who started occupying the area in the 1980s, the six-figure reported median income would likely not be representative of a community of struggling artists. This statistic more likely represents a community of successful professionals and educated adults in terms of their economic status. The shift also highlights the new appeal of the Arts District as a trendy and vibrant revived urban community - a SoHo of the West Coast, so to speak. That is not to say that the artists are all removed from the Arts District in today’s society. Rather, the overwhelming majority of the current community is vastly different from the original residents both in an economic and a racial context.

In addition to the vibrant murals and street art that are characteristic of Downtown LA’s Arts District, many high-end coffee shops, eateries, and clothing boutiques are becoming a major source of commercial identity for the rapidly evolving community, and is therefore reflective of its incoming residents. Instead of being the known home of famed murals that critiqued the social systems and society as a whole in the late 20th century, the Arts District is now home to overpriced storefronts that tailor specifically to the bourgeoisie. Take, for example, a bakery-coffee-shop-duo called The Pie Hole, located directly next to the heart of the old Arts District now known as Joel Bloom Square. The Pie Hole features an expansive list of exotic pies, deluxe beverages, and select breakfast items, none of which can be considered particularly affordable or practical for a typical and authentic “artist” resident. If The Pie Hole’s menu prices-out a section of the Arts District population that is representative of the artists themselves, then their menu of items that are all priced above a typical quality-bakery must then cater to the new bourgeoisie residents of the area. 

The mere price points of such storefronts as The Pie Hole effectively establishes the type of crowd that is attracted to visiting and residing in the Arts District as a relatively wealthier one than the original Arts District residents. According to Marisa Gerber in her LA Times article, “Arts District’s Changing Landscape is Worrisome to Longtime Residents,” “Although the [neighborhood] growth means less crime and more eatery options, some neighborhood veterans say it’s hard to watch their once-left-alone, eclectic heaven turn into a trendy and expensive destination that they expect to be priced out of.” Not only are the “neighborhood veterans” mercilessly being economically discriminated against in these modern and expensive storefronts, but they are also arguably being excluded from and ultimately forgotten in what is now the new identity of the Arts District. As a result, modern and trendy Arts District eateries and boutiques are commercially targeting the same white-collar demographic that the neighborhood as a whole is coming to represent in an economic context, and is simultaneously distancing the neighborhood’s communal identity from its authentic roots in financial hardship and poverty.

With the gradual process of gentrification plowing its way through the Arts District comes the transformation of the drafty warehouses into luxury apartment complexes that are geared towards a wealthier demographic and the consequent market. Perhaps the most notable of these real estate development projects is the new One Santa Fe residential complex, situated on the outskirts of the Arts District and bordering the Los Angeles River. As Adrian Glick Kudler reported in his 2012 article with Curbed Los Angeles, “The project will be six stories and have 438 apartments (20 percent affordable), 50,000 square feet of public outdoor space, and 78,620 of office and retail space,” and is also a staggering $160 million project. The amount of funding and press that the One Santa Fe development has received since its opening suggests that the real estate market in the Arts District is gradually drawing only those who can afford luxury apartments, and is perfect evidence for the gentrification occurring in the area. More importantly, however, Rachel Cohrs of USC Annenberg Media comments that “The new, massive One Santa Fe development project is controversial in the community because it is a symbol of the encroachment of development on what artists feel to be a sacred space.” Instead of the project maintaining the visual aesthetic of the preexisting neighborhood, the One Santa Fe development effectively creates a new visual aesthetic that is divergent from the original - it sticks out like a sore thumb. The development’s visual divergence from the theme of the neighborhood mirrors the divergence of the project’s morals and purpose from the founding principles of the community. Instead of being a haven for financially struggling artists who essentially formed the neighborhood by illegal habitation, One Santa Fe embodies and attracts the very class of people that the artists were attempting to escape in the first place. Thus, not only are the artists being priced-out of the residential opportunities, their memory and presence are also gradually being drowned in the shadow of the impeding modern residential complexes.

The changing demographic and visual makeup of the district’s community is also directly highlighted by the area’s transition from thought-provoking to “Instagrammable” visual street art representations of the current, gentrified version of the Arts District. Despite the occasional murals that critique some aspect of society, such as the Undiscovered America mural originally completed by Earth Crew 2000 in 1992 (Earth Crew Mural Dedication, Archival Materials), an overwhelming majority of the street art in the Arts District are less rooted in political statements than they are in aesthetic and visual appeal. Part of this can be accounted for by the uptrend in the use of social media, and is therefore representative of a relatively youthful mindset. As Marisa Gerber observed, “Richardson Banks mentioned her Instagram account as an example. A few years ago only a handful of pictures popped up under #artsdistrict. Now it’s flooded with shots of murals and latte art, and she’s expanded her hashtag repertoire to keep up with her changing neighborhood: #megadevelopment, #construction, #gentrification.” The recent rise in social media has contributed to the change in aesthetic style of the street art in order to continue to captivate its evolving audience. In the case of the Arts District, that means moving away from the neighborhood’s roots and towards a social media user’s haven. That is not to say that the newer street art is meaningless. It instead lures and reflects the meanings that most strongly relate to the younger population. To be more specific, the older murals in the community arguably contain an underlying message that somehow critiques an issue in the political, economic, or social realms and likewise emphasizes the hardship that the neighborhood veterans experienced on a daily basis. The messages of the murals and art of today adhere to the general theme of self-empowerment and focus on building internal confidence. The popular murals depicting a pair of vibrant and decorative wings - sometimes accompanied by a (tacky) inspirational message - have come to embody the Arts District on Instagram especially. These wings were created by Collette Miller as part of her universal venture titled the Global Angel Wings Project. The murals “were painted to remind humanity that we are the angels of this earth. They are human sized interactive public art, wings that people take photos with and thus become part of the work” (Global Angel Wings Project Website). Instead of representing the suffering of the local community as the older murals did, the main mission of Miller’s murals embodies the individual’s self-love and self-appreciation movement. By including the photo-taking and sharing aspect of the murals in the mission statement of the project, the Global Angel Wings Project illuminates the role of modern social media usage in determining what users think of as art. Consequently, the use of social media and the contemporary mindset is causing the art in the Arts District to rapidly evolve to suit the current society’s wants and needs of art.

In an era where many artists fear the potential of being priced out of the neighborhood that embodies their life’s work and fundamental principles, a local non-profit space, Art Share L.A., is attempting to keep the “arts” and “artists” in the Arts District through live/work spaces. According to the organization’s mission statement on ArtShareLA.org, “Art Share L.A. offers 30 live/work lofts on the top floor of [the] building. The units are low-income ranging from 400 to 650 square feet. Rents are low enough that we allow artists to focus on building their business or creating their work of art, instead of working to live.” By understanding that the rising rent and sales prices of residential units in the Arts District is threatening to expel lower-income artists, partners at Art Share LA have provided an opportunity to keep the artists in the Arts District. In doing so, the organization has essentially pledged allegiance to the preservation of the Arts District’s original character. Art Share L.A.’s heroic mission simultaneously recognizes the importance of the artists’ contributions to the identity of the neighborhood, especially at a time when the artists are slowly being forgotten. The big problem, however, is that there are more artists in need of such low-income live/work spaces than there are spaces themselves. As Cohrs reported of Art Share L.A. in 2016, “The lofts are in high demand; the current waiting list has around 80 artists on it, and the list grows longer every week.” While it may be a positive that the neighborhood is gaining commercial and residential recognition, this regional economic expansion comes at the cost of replacing authenticity with wealth. Thus, the repercussions of gentrification, in terms of the rising cost of living, unfortunately pose a credible threat to the integrity, values, and character of the Arts District that used to be.

In addition to attempting to keep the artists in the Arts District, there have been recent efforts to preserve the visual character of the community via the preservation of historic murals that are distinctly unique to the neighborhood as a whole. Some of this preservation is in the form of restoring older murals that became a staple for the community. For example, Earth Crew 2000 recently renewed the Undiscovered America mural that was initially created by members of Earth Crew and local community members in 1992. The mural “features the still-little known achievements of Native American nations from Alaska to Argentine, such as arts, agriculture, writing and science, and their gift for living in harmony with nature. With a medicine wheel at the center, the mural celebrates the end of a 500-year cycle of colonization, and the inauguration of a new era of multicultural collaboration” (Earth Crew Mural Dedication, Archival Records).

The Undiscovered America mural outwardly displays a deep ethnic meaning and represents the hardships of community members more than some of its contemporary counterparts. The mural itself pays tribute to the struggles of the indigenous populations and also welcomes the end of their suffering by being located in the geographic center of the Arts District itself. The central location of the mural in the community also symbolizes its important role in depicting and paying homage to some original members of the small society. The modern preservation of this historically significant mural, however, marks a valiant effort to protect the cultural and ethnic roots of the old Arts District amidst gentrification. The example of this preservation suggests that perhaps some original aspects of the Arts District’s true character will persist in the same way that the Undiscovered America mural lives on through communal initiative.

Gentrification is hitting the Arts District - and hitting it rapidly - and is replacing the wafty industrial infrastructures with glamorized and “boujee” contemporary versions of it. Though the additional attention and fascination with the neighborhood has brought commercial and economic validity to its local businesses and their constituents, it has meanwhile sacrificed the Arts District’s bonafide character. While on the surface the Arts District is more vibrant and developed than its older counterpart, some of the communal authenticity remains on a much deeper level. In order to preserve the integrity of the Arts District, however, it is up to more than just a few individuals to take action and prevent the process of gentrification from completely obliterating what truly makes the Arts District the Arts District. Without remembrance and conservation efforts, the imposing gentrification threatens to erase the unique history and significance of the Arts District, morphing it instead into a homogenous neighborhood with little to no memory of its industrial history.
