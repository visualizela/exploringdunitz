When discussing Los Angeles’ desirable West side, images of picturesque rows of tall palm trees lining streets with high-end retail stores at every corner come to mind. West LA is able to achieve a reputation as one of LA’s most affluent neighborhoods only as a result of segregating “undesirables” from the area; this is accomplished through rising home prices, emphasis on education, and infrastructural barriers like the highway loop. Current housing prices in West LA are considerably higher than the rest of LA County. In fact, prices will continue to rise in the coming years, making it even more challenging to purchase a home in the area, particularly for people of lower socioeconomic status. Additionally, West LA’s reputation as a highly successful community is, in part, shaped by the emphasis it places on education with UCLA located in the heart of the district. While UCLA has a tremendously diverse student body, a great deal of its students cannot afford the luxuries of the neighborhood, and consequently, they are simply there as students rather than as members of the community. Lastly, despite that West LA provides accommodations for its homeless population, it segregates these people from the community with infrastructural barriers such as highways and roads.

West LA’s history begins in 1887 when the founders of Santa Monica donated land to the Federal Government for the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers (Los Angeles Conservancy). Several decades later in 1919, the University of California at Los Angeles was founded, expanding the district of West LA into Westwood. The land was originally used for agriculture, specifically bean fields and orchards (Garner). Small businesses became common on major boulevards and developers began constructing apartments throughout the district following World War II (Garner). Today, West LA is among the most affluent districts in Los Angeles County. The district is comprised of several affluent neighborhoods including Westwood, Brentwood, and Santa Monica.

Demographically, West Los Angeles is primarily comprised of high-income residents from an array of ethnic backgrounds. With a population of just over 200,000, the ethnic distribution of West LA is roughly 52.4 percent Caucasian, 20.8 percent Asian, and 18.1 percent Hispanic (Data USA). In terms of education, West LA’s residents are highly educated compared to the average Los Angeles district with 60.4 percent of residents 25 years or older possessing a four-year college degree. Accordingly, with a median household income of $86,403, West LA ranks highly in terms of income relative to the rest of Los Angeles. Additionally, West LA’s considerable military population makes it a unique area demographically. Overall, West LA is a diverse, prosperous district with a reputation as a desirable residential and commercial area and, as a result, housing prices have skyrocketed in the past decades.

While West LA is widely regarded as a highly desirable place to live, only a small fraction of LA’s residents can actually afford to live there. In fact, the median home value in West LA is over $1.5 million, notably higher than the average home value in all of Los Angeles, which is just under $1 million (Paris). Furthermore, these home values will only increase in the foreseeable future; over the next year, West LA home values are projected to increase by 9.2 percent. Home buyers, regardless of their financial status, should expect difficulty in the search for a home in West LA as availability of homes is fleeting. Ellen Paris, Los Angeles residential real estate expert, suggests that buyers seeking a home in West LA “be ready to move fast as homes stayed on the market only 19 days” in some cases (Paris). Paris emphasizes the scarcity of available homes in West LA as homes are only on the market for short periods of time. Moreover, this stresses the high level of competition involved in purchasing a West LA home. This competitiveness results from West LA’s reputation as a desirable community to live in. As a result of high home prices and low availability of residences, only the richest residents can afford to live in the area, preventing citizens who are not at the top of the socioeconomic hierarchy from residing in the area.
There are a number of factors contributing to West LA’s high housing prices, beginning with Legislation that was created several decades ago.  According to USC Lusk Center for Real Estate director Richard K. Green, the housing problem in Los Angeles began in the mid 1970s with the enactment of Proposition 13. The legislation “froze property taxes and discouraged people from moving. The law [kept] the inventory of housing low” (Rothbard). Furthermore, Green suggests that Southern California simply did not develop enough houses to support the sheer number of people residing in the area. West LA is a prime example of a neighborhood with high, yet increasing, housing prices due to the factors listed by Green. As a result, the housing market in West LA is especially competitive.

It is important to consider why West LA is such a desirable location for home-buyers despite the considerable cost of living. High home prices typically result in visually pleasing, state-of-the-art home designs and neighborhoods. In West LA, there is an emphasis on city beautification, beginning with luxurious homes. The Community Beautification Grant has contributed to the beautification of several areas in West LA. The program allows volunteers to request large sums of money in order to enhance and beautify an area of town. Thanks to the Community Beautification Grant, members of the community have completed the Gateway Project to the History Venice Canals, the Grand View Parkway, and the Greening the Palisades Project. Paul Racs, director of the Office of Community Beautification explains that “these workshops are central in [the] outreach for the public’s effort to keep Los Angeles beautiful” (Improve ‘West Los Angeles’). Evidently, the community goes to great lengths to maintain the beauty of the area and there is a strong emphasis on the visual appeal of the neighborhood. These beautification efforts are conducive to the desirable reputation of West LA and, in turn, they attract potential home-buyers, further driving housing prices upwards.

In the heart of the neighborhood of Westwood is UCLA, one of the top public universities in the United States, however, a great deal of its students does not experience the typical Westwood lifestyle. A considerable proportion of UCLA’s undergraduate students cannot afford the luxuries available to the majority of Westwood residents. For example, international students, students who are undocumented citizens, and first-generation college students often lack the financial resources to live the lifestyle of most Westwood residents. Often times, they cannot afford to go to local restaurants, shop at retailers, or participate in leisure activities. In 2017, UCLA enrolled 3,645 international students, or 11.8 percent of all newly enrolled students. Accordingly, UCLA is home to a considerable number of students who often struggle to support themselves financially in everyday life. For that reason, these students are not entirely integrated into the community due to their inability to afford the luxuries that most Westwood residents can. Despite the fact that these students reside within Westwood’s geographic boundaries, they are segregated due to financial implications.Similar to a significant proportion of UCLA’s student body, veterans in West LA are segregated from the heart of their community as well. Despite efforts to develop homeless shelters for veterans-a seemingly effective solution to a growing homelessness problem-urban planning situates veteran homeless shelters and other veteran services near infrastructural boundaries such as highways, segregating them from the community. For example, New Directions for Veterans is a veteran empowerment organization in West LA, however, it is located in the outskirts of Brentwood next to Interstate-405. Similarly, the Los Angeles National Cemetery, a cemetery for fallen veterans, is cornered into the intersection of Interstate-405 and Wilshire Boulevard, separated from the rest of the neighborhood. These infrastructural boundaries limit veterans’ access to the heart of Brentwood; accordingly, the geographic restrictions imposed on the homeless veteran population are enough to remove them from everyday life in the community. While homeless veterans have an array of services available to them, infrastructural obstacles segregate them from true city life because it helps cultivate a favorable reputation for West LA.

West LA has developed a reputation as one of the most affluent, desirable areas in all of Los Angeles County, however, it only achieved this status by separating “undesirables” from the community. As a result of high and rapidly increasing housing prices, not even members of the upper middle class can afford to live in some areas of West LA. Consequently, members of lower socioeconomic status are inherently segregated from the community. Additionally, UCLA’s significant presence in West LA demonstrates the emphasis on education in the district. That being said, a great deal of UCLA’s students is far from integrated into the West LA community because these students lack the financial resources. Like most areas in Los Angeles, West LA has a considerable homeless population, heavily comprised of veterans. While accommodations for homeless veterans such as homeless shelters and empowerment organizations exist in West LA, they are situated near infrastructural barriers in such a way that these residents are separated from the rest of the community. Evidently, West LA significantly enhances its public image and reputation through efforts to remove less desirable aspects. It is important to acknowledge how the community goes to great lengths to solidify its strong reputation. This way, one can understand that a community’s affluence and prosperity can come at a great cost.
