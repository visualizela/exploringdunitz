desc: "Venice, California, has recently evolved from a boutique-focused art center to a popular commerce, as a result of increasing rates of tourism. This has resulted in a major conflict, driven mostly by gentrification and there are clear gaps in demographic factors such as race and class. There needs to be resolutions set in place, or else Venice will lose its unique bohemian culture to the corporate masses."

Much like its counterpart in Europe, the Venice of California must undergo a renaissance in an attempt to find its true identity. Long known as “The Slum by the Sea” because of the shacks and simple bungalows that hosted many destitute constituents, it has since transformed into a tourist and entertainment center primarily catering to people of high status. This has created conflict between the original citizens of Venice and the newcomers who are not only racially different but also possessing more wealth and demanding a culture change. The artsy beach culture of Venice is threatened to disappear without major intervention from the proper authorities and resolve from all parties of the ensuing conflict. This evolution can be traced to when Venice was just a boutique-focused art center only populated by the likes of artists and those of eclectic nature. When GQ Magazine recognized Abbott Kinney Boulevard as the “coolest block in America” in 2012, the inflow of wealthy tourists created an uneasy equilibrium between long-time locals and prominent newcomers. The wealth disparity and racial differences led to gentrification and even the economic viability of the town is now being questioned as sky-rocketing price of rent clashes with long-established cultural enclaves. There is a general consensus that change is needed in Venice in order to resolve the ever-widening gap between different demographics and become a cultural center that truly lives up to its namesake.

Venice, California was founded in the early 1900s in order to fulfill a vision of a better place of higher learning and health benefits. Abbot Kinney, the city’s founder, wanted intellectuals to come and pursue their dreams while enjoying the ocean air. However, the people of Venice decided they’d rather have amusement parks and carnivals, and Kinney gave in to their wishes. This proved untenable and following Kinney’s death in 1920, “Venice voted to become a part of the City of Los Angeles” (“Venice California History”). Venice was later transformed by the discovery of oil and known as the “Slum by the Sea” when oil prospects died down and enterprising discoverers became poor settlers. This moniker remained until the 1950s, where bodybuilding became all the rage. In the 1970s, Venice was flooded with all sorts of people, “a culture of artists, musicians, and poets [led by cheap rent and vibe of individuality] (“Venice California History”). The birth of this culture proved instrumental for the diversity of Venice and helped establish Venice as a beach town for artist newcomers and enterprising folks. Not only that, the infusion of culture as a result of these newcomers provided an unique vibe of street art and the creation of the Venice Boardwalk only helped everyone experience the distinct way of life there. However, this changed for the worse once Venice was plopped straight into GQ Magazine.
   
Abbot Kinney Boulevard was named the “coolest block of America” in the GQ Magazine in 2012. The fame from the magazine propelled Venice, California to the forefront of wealthy Americans’ minds and only exacerbated the rising prices for real estate and tourist activity that were already in place. Venice became a brand, attracting top notch technology companies and famous Hollywood actors and actresses. One of these companies was Google, well known for its search engine and various other products for consumers. The new campus housed “about 500 Google employees in the Frank Gehry-designed building at 340 Main St.” and it allowed Google to close previous locations in Santa Monica, allowing for a more unified team in the Los Angeles area (Page). Alongside Snap Inc., the creator of the powerhouse app Snapchat, and other prominent companies, Venice suddenly became known as “Silicon Beach.” Abbot Kinney Boulevard was also transformed as global names moved in to take over once-local establishments. The transformation can also be seen in drastic real estate price changes. Back “In 1996, according to data provided by Zillow, the average home value in Venice was $251,000 […] Today, Venice’s average home value is nearly $1.6 million” (Aron). A five-fold price increase is only one of the changes observed when a humble beach town turns into a major tourist attraction. It means that housing supply has stayed constant while demand has grown exponentially and that commercial developers are salivating at the idea of new projects in Venice, California. Many long-time locals have felt the burden as expenses soared and can no longer afford to stay in the place they call home. Clearly, the revamp of Venice as a town has come at the cost of racial and class inclusiveness. 

Venice has grown in significantly in size of population over the past decade, resulting in one of the highest densities for Los Angeles County. Although this density consists of “11,891 people per square mile,” the more concerning fact lies in how high the percentage of white people is (“Venice”). In relation to the rest of the county, it is considered extremely high, at “64.2% of the population” and even “the percentage of households earning $125,000 and up is high for the county” (“Venice”). From this information, we can infer that the proliferation of wealthy white people outweighs how low the median household income is (about $67,647 in 2008 dollars). One of the major concerns is how the population continues to increase even though housing construction is even over time, indicating that people who can no longer afford to live in Venice move out and new residents who can afford the hefty cost take their place. Venice has become inundated with people and the housing market won’t get any better as locals refuse to change regulatory building laws to better accommodate the new population. A conflict has risen between the newcomers mainly composed of rich, white people and the locals mainly composed of low-income to middle-class ethnicities.

Gentrification is the driving force behind the wave of upper-class takeovers in Venice. Defined as “the process of renovating and improving a house or district so that it conforms to middle-class taste,” it has changed Abbot Kinney Boulevard from a funky street made for cultural crossover and with independent shops catering to a bohemian vibe into an upscale commercial scene lined with expensive products and luxury brand names (“Gentrification”). Not only that, the residential areas, particularly along the shoreline, has been taken over and re-sold for millions of dollars. Every square foot mattered since Venice still has a “zoning ordinance on many lots that have been purchased thus far, restricting everything from building height to building extension size” (“Generalized Summary of Zoning Regulations – City of Los Angeles”). This complexity to the housing market has contributed to the shortage and remains a reason why even though some houses remain empty, prices are at an all-time high because the building doesn’t fit the needs of the next person buying it.

Venice’s evolution into a popular commerce based on tourism has displaced many local businesses who can no longer afford sky-high rent prices and flagship businesses such as Adidas, Avocado, and Lemonade have taken their spot. Their main goal is simply profiting off of unknowing tourists, or rather those who can afford to waste money on such expensive products. It’s gotten to the point where “there’s been a severe shortage of Venice hotel rooms” which can mean that only those who are truly wealthy can afford to come and visit (Friedersdorf). When people are displaced from their homes, they are forced to move to another part of the city (Los Angeles has many different cultural neighborhoods that would be an option) or they become homeless. Gentrification has led to a new homeless crisis, especially prominent in Venice. The astronomical cost of rent has stopped more homeless shelters from being constructed and those already existing are fill beyond capacity. Tent cities have become more common, even right on Venice Beach.

There is a severe wealth disparity and this situation is untenable. The newcomers can’t keep driving the locals out and the long-time residents won’t go without a fight to stay in their homes, most often, their birthplace. In the end, both sides of the new community have to get together and decide what steps to take in order to resolve this major issue. However, that is difficult when racial bigotry is involved in the gentrification of Venice, California. 
   
One of the last ethnic enclaves of Venice, called Oakwood, is currently threatened by the tide of newcomers and the residents are ready to push back. Originally set aside for the African Americans who helped build Venice more than a century ago, it has now become more prominent with Latinos and also serves as a close community for those who currently live there. Not only that, Oakwood continues to serve as the home of Venice 13, a Mexican-American street gang infamous for their fights with the Venice Shoreline Crips and other local gangs. There is a clear separation between the Oakwood community and the rest of Venice as illustrated here: “Abbot Kinney Boulevard is now becoming a border that separates two distinct communities in Venice […] an area which is historically a low-income and working-class Black and Latino section of the neighborhood […] an anomaly in terms of neighborhood gentrification” (Deener, 292). Even this deterrence hasn’t discouraged the middle and upper-class invasion that has been common in other areas of Venice, as proper authorities such as police have stepped up activity in Oakwood and civil gang injunctions have been introduced in the community. Donald Coulter, life-long resident of the Oakwood community, says, “‘We don’t feel welcome here. Wrong complexion,’ and another man said he could be detained just for greeting a friend in the street while whites rode bikes without lights and walked dogs off leashes, trivial-seeming violations that underlined racial inequality” (Carroll). Clearly, the newcomers want to drive out anyone who doesn’t fit their standards of living, resulting in racial oppression as seen in Oakwood. Other communities within Venice have already suffered the assault of gentrification and many lost their properties to new commercial developments or were simply replaced by a richer, white family. This points toward a loss of inclusion within Venice, long famed for their welcome and message of diversity. It appears that Venice has lost its way, catering now to the demands of wealthy residents and commercialized corporations rather than its artists, people of eclectic nature, and most importantly, their minorities. 
   
Even the Venice Boardwalk has fallen prey to the rules of gentrification, ruining what was once the prominent center for diverse entertainment in the town. When the Venice Boardwalk was first created in the 1970s, a bike path had just begun anew and roller skates were in the vogue. Now, it represents a half mile of street vendors and performers on one side while the other side represents all the storefronts peddling t-shirts and “unique” Venice artifacts. This is the brightest tourist attraction in Venice and reason people continue to visit. It represents the true mix of street art and beach life that has been Venice’s motto in the late 1900s. However, restrictions have been made recently on the boardwalk artists, who now require “a permit for a designated space under an ordinance” (Daily News). The Los Angeles City Council felt that this was the best way to go about protecting free speech and expression while also limiting unwanted commercial activity. This was raised as an issue due to the unique atmosphere that entertainers need while the residents would rather want some quiet enjoyment in their beachfront homes. Meanwhile, shops have taken a bigger presence in drawing tourists to the area, with luxury establishments opening in place of moved-out restaurants and retailers. The temporary stopgap of using permits won’t work for very long since other major issues will be raised by one of the groups that are along Venice Beach. One of these is how to contend with the homeless encampments that are currently on the beach. After interviewing several beachfront artisans, there was a conclusion amongst them all that the city needed to take action about the living condition for the homeless. Sergio, who has been selling handcrafted wood panels since 2005, made a big point in mentioning how homeless tents have “multiplied exponentially since I first started selling my products” (Zheng et al.). Necessary action needs to be taken by city of Los Angeles or else Venice will begin falling apart. It is only a matter of time before disparity between opposing groups become too large to bridge a gap and Venice will suffer a loss of not only their unique beach art life but also its failure to remain true to its lifelong residents. 

Artists, once the most prominent of Venice’s bohemian culture, are now subject to the same problems that face the rest of Venice. However, they can be the key for Venice’s revival as a town which accepts not only diversity but can remain true to their origins as outlined by Abbot Kinney. The founder of Venice wanted it to be a place of higher learning and where people could pursue their dreams. Not only has gentrification, among other major problems, stopped the latter, but it completely denies the former. Any place that refuses to care about its people will lose their respective will, dedication, and dreams. It will lose its purpose and what it means to be a home. Even now, street art remains a big part of Venice and its publicity is only increased due to exposure on many mediums (from the Internet all the way to word of mouth). Street art is all about “expression, creativity, and freedom […] It’s a way to step beyond convention” and with this method, artists can protest the many problems that are existent in Venice today (Janaline).

From painting murals on now-abandoned houses to drawing strong political statements for any in the public to see, it raises attention to the issue that is present within the art. For the residents of Venice, it represents a hope that things can get better and the movement energizes the local base to fight back against systematic inequality by the oppressors.

Venice has been permanently changed in all aspects since its inclusion in the 2012 GQ Magazine. While its original bohemian culture remains in niches, it is in danger of being wiped out due to growing disparities in demographic factors such as race and wealth. Newcomers and their refusal to accommodate the locals that they’re displacing has created conflict that cannot be resolved easily. This model of rapid commercialization is not sustainable and detrimental as a whole to people who want to keep their unique culture intact. People must recognize that there is not just one way to go about the evolution of a city. There are multiples ways, and some of which can keep the most important traits from the previous era, in this case, accepting diversity to ensure cultural vitality. Change is often for the better, but for new Venice to attain the heights that the old Venice of Italy reached, it must continue to be willing to accept all groups of people, regardless of their respective backgrounds and remain true to their nonconformist origins.
