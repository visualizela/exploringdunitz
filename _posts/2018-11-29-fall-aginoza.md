All-you-can-eat Korean barbecue, nightclubs, and a plethora of boba shops are very prominent throughout Koreatown but only serve as the tip of the iceberg of what actually constitutes it. Although Koreatown appears “Korean” upon a superficial glance, the neighborhood includes diverse groups with a vivid history, a metropolitan center plagued by gentrification, and a unique art domain. Koreatown’s history begins with the immigration of the first Koreans to California and then continues with the establishment of Korean Christian Churches as the core of all of Koreatown. As the population of Koreatown expanded and became more urbanized, a demographic shift began to take place along with the dawn of gentrification in the realtor and transit sectors. Gentrification also heavily influenced Koreatown’s abundance of public art while its signage held true and evolved with the times. 

   Before Koreatown became the bustling and diverse hub it is today, it went through many changes in the span of one hundred years. The first of those changes was the immigration of the Koreans to California. According to Myung (2015), the first Korean immigrants arrived in Hawaii in 1903 to escape Japanese oppression and later  to California around 1910. The Koreans could have stayed in Hawaii and settled there, but they decided to move to California instead; on the mainland, the quality of jobs and the sheer number of job opportunities were substantially better. Koreans were attracted to Hawaii in the first place because Hawaiian plantation contractors made working there seem as if they were working in paradise. Unfortunately, plantation work was arduous and did not live up to the dream-like expectations they were promised. Spending ten hours each day doing blue collar work in hot and humid weather for an unsubstantial wage was not the life they had in mind when moving to paradise. In fact, Korean plantation workers earned around seventy cents for a ten hour day while railroad wages in California ranged from $1.20 to $1.50, depending on the type of contract (Shin, 1971). The eventual immigration of Koreans to the U.S. should not be seen as a surprise since other ethnic groups were migrating to the U.S. for similar reasons. America, to the immigrants, was seen as the land of opportunity and success, and they wanted to be a part of it as well. 

   In contrast to the many businesses located in Koreatown today, the origins of Koreatown were rooted in the first Korean immigrants and their ties to Christianity. Once the first wave of Koreans arrived in California, they settled in San Francisco and then branched outward from there and eventually reached Los Angeles. Unlike the Japanese and Chinese communities that emerged abroad in the United States and other highly concentrated Asian immigrant areas, the Koreans lacked a strong clan affiliation and form of social organization. Simply put, they did not have any resemblance of subgrouping such as clans from a bloodline or trade within their own small population of Korean immigrants. This absence of association led to many Korean immigrants following Christianity, specifically Protestantism and not Catholicism. Some of the main churches that formed the core of the Korean community in Los Angeles were the Korean Presbyterian Church, the L.A. Christian Church, the L.A. Korean Methodist Church, and the Christian Church of Los Angeles (Givens, 1939). Most of the Korean immigrants’ social activities occurred through Korean Christian churches; these churches that missionaries and Korean Christian pastors originally established for worship turned into organizational hubs for the entire community. Various recreational clubs for young Korean men and women formed once the Korean Christian churches were established as the core. The Squires Club, a club for Korean boys from ages fourteen to seventeen, was dedicated to athletics and social life (Givens, 1939). Normally, the Squires Club would play its basketball and volleyball games on an outdoor court, but when weather did not permit outside play, games were held in an indoor church gym. The Korean churches were both a place of social and recreational activity but also a place of worship as most of the Korean immigrants would congregate together on Sundays for worship, thus laying the foundation for the core of Koreatown.

   After the Korean Christian churches served as the first place of high social interaction among the Korean immigrants, expansion was soon to follow. The first significant change in Koreatown’s young history was the implementation of a business-oriented community. In order to bring about that change, seventy-three small businesses, some of which were small grocery markets, opened in the early 1930s (Myung, 2015). The launch of such a substantial number of businesses forever transformed the blueprint of the Koreatown community and paved the way for it to become the booming urban center it is today. What started out as a religious center and place for Sunday worship, became a place for recreational, social, cultural, and soon political activity. As Koreatown continued to develop and widen its influence, its population increased and its borders expanded as well. Adams Boulevard served as the north boundary with Slauson Boulevard in the south, Vermont Avenue in the east, and Western Avenue in the west (Myung, 2015). As more immigrants populated Koreatown, its old borders would not suffice to comfortably house the growing population. Businesses also broadened with the population, and outside companies began moving in to seize their opportunity in the up and coming Koreatown. All of these factors would soon lead to a huge demographic shift in which the population more closely resembled the population of Koreatown today.

   For the longest time, Koreans remained the majority of the population in Koreatown, but over time their expansion from their original location led to interactions with the massive Hispanic and African-American population that lived in and around Los Angeles as well. Census data from 2017 showed that the Hispanic population was the majority and made up 51 percent of the total Koreatown population, with the Asian population next at 34 percent (U.S. Census Bureau, 2017). This breakdown of population demonstrates how much the demographics of Koreatown changed from the time when the first immigrants arrived in 1930. At first, Koreans easily formed the majority simply because they were the only ones there at the time. The formation of businesses and social interaction between Koreans and the Hispanic, white, and African-American ethnic groups are the reasons why the demographic makeup of Koreatown changed so much. The original stereotype of Koreatown as a one-dimensional and singular ethnic community was no longer true; it became a melting pot for people of all races. As the different ethnic groups moved in and out of Koreatown, some established their own businesses and decided to make Koreatown their home as well, thus further expanding the borders of Koreatown and further cementing its status as an economic and commercial hub. Although the growth of Koreatown came with many benefits, it had its share of downfalls as well, which are mostly related to gentrification and business growth.

   As a budding Koreatown continues its rapid expansion, developers and big market companies are taking their chances to develop within Koreatown, which is displacing the current residents. Today, Koreatown is already one of the most densely packed areas in Los Angeles with a variety of businesses. In the span of a couple blocks, one can find numerous mom and pop grocery stores, authentic Korean restaurants, nightclubs, various fast food venues, boba drink stores, and even more. Although Koreatown already seems as if it could not become any more packed, the scary truth is that it is getting worse. No fewer than thirty buildings are being proposed to be built in numerous locations throughout Koreatown (Aron, 2017). Each of these buildings are estimated to be between ten and thirty stories tall with each set to have some type of housing with it. Not all of the proposed projects will be built, but even if a fraction of them are built, the impact on the current residents will be enormous. As Koreatown’s reputation as the walkable and transit centered hub of Los Angeles continues to bolster itself, the local residents continue to suffer; they will be forced to find other cheaper places for housing since even the non-luxury apartments will be out of their price range. Another tragic fact is that gentrification has been occurring for more than ten years already. In 2005, ten mega development projects were in the process of approval, each of which forcing the local residents to find new and more affordable housing options (Park & Kim, 2008). The living situations for these people are only worsening over time. Some residents have probably been forced to move on multiple occasions because their neighborhoods are already gentrified or currently in the process of becoming gentrified. The low income residents, of which most are color, become trapped in this vicious cycle of settling down in one place and then having to move again with a sizeable number of citizens ending up in homelessness. Gentrification has not only occurred in the business and realtor sectors but also in the transit sector as well. 

   In an effort to increase ridership, which has gone down drastically in recent years, transit companies are deciding to reward companies who develop in areas that are adjacent to bus and metro lines. At first glance, the idea of providing incentives for housing developers to bring ridership back up again makes sense, but the transit companies are forgetting one important component: the population that most frequently uses bus and metro lines. One study showed that 88% of metro bus riders are people of color, and more than 50% have annual family incomes of less than $15,000 (Rosenthal, 2018). The transit developers believe they are putting themselves in a win-win situation by building housing developments near bus and metro stops, but in reality they are actually displacing the population that most often uses their means of transportation. The development of these new buildings forces the current residents out of their homes when the landowner’s property is bought out and also raises the rent prices for homes and apartments around the new building. Even if the residents are not directly bought out of their home, the rising prices will be sure to drive them out in the long run. If the transit companies truly wished to increase their ridership, they would focus on the tenants rather than just the sheer number of housing units. Increasing development and gentrification are not only negatively affecting the local residents of Koreatown but also its local public art installations.

   Before Koreatown became such a booming urban center, the number of murals it was home to was significantly larger. During my group’s visit to Koreatown, our main goal was to visit various murals around Koreatown and to take pictures and notes on them. Throughout our time exploring Koreatown, around half of the murals we were looking for had been torn down and replaced by newer development; the only ones that we were able to find were located inside of the numerous metro stations around Koreatown. In fact, there are five metro stops, which are for the red line and purple line, spread in the east and northern ends of Koreatown (“Red Line,” 2018). The fact that we were only able to find murals inside of the metro stations around Koreatown shows how greatly development and gentrification have impacted Koreatown in general. Placing the murals in the metro stations took away from the intimacy and user interaction with the mural since the only way to observe them was from a fenced platform rather than up close. The map that held information for all of the murals in Koreatown was created in the early 1990s, so it makes sense that some of the murals on that map did not exist today. Interestingly enough, one of the murals was replaced by a very new and modern apartment style living space that was still selling its units, which perfectly exemplifies gentrification.  While murals have been adversely affected by the development of Koreatown, signage has rather been forced to change with the times. 

   Koreatown may be one of the only places where a sign in Korean and Spanish without any English translation can be found. Signage around Koreatown is one of its most identifying characteristics and is one of the key aspects that differentiate Koreatown from its surrounding areas such as downtown Los Angeles and West Hollywood. If one had not visited Koreatown before, one would expect that the majority of the signs in Koreatown would be only in Korean and maybe some in English, but the reality is quite different. This is mostly due to the fact that the Hispanic population of Koreatown is large and makes up 51 percent, with Asian at the next highest concentration of 34 percent (U.S. Census Bureau, 2017). After the Korean Christian Churches were established at its core and Koreatown began expanding, many people from different ethnic backgrounds began to call Koreatown their home, mainly the Hispanic, African-American, and white demographics. The signage of Koreatown is a true representation of the various people who live there and demonstrates how far Koreatown has evolved since its inception. 

   Koreatown’s humble beginnings started with the immigration of Korean plantation workers from Hawaii to California. The Koreans’ Christian roots ultimately led to the formation of Korean Christian Churches as the central hub of Koreatown. Over time, a steadily growing population and increasing urbanization caused an alteration in Koreatown’s demographics and sowed the seeds of gentrification in the realtor and transit sectors. Gentrification also heavily decreased the number of public art works in Koreatown while the signage evolved and reflected its true inhabitants. Despite appearing “Korean” upon a perfunctory glance, Koreatown is home to an extremely diverse population, a bustling urban center overcome by gentrification, and a varied art environment. Boba shops at every corner and all-you-can-eat anything are only a small fraction of what Koreatown truly is. Koreatown remains an integral part of Los Angeles although its abundance of commercial outlets that appeal to the late teen and early to mid-twenties demographic mask its true identity.
