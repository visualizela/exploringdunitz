Los Angeles currently has about 55,000 homeless individuals and about 1 in 10 Californians are living near or in poverty. Californian society wants to believe that it is a model community for achieving social justice. However, community changes demonstrate that California prioritizes its tourist economy and desires of its affluent residents far more than it is concerned about the displacement of low-income households and providing resources to the homeless. Venice Beach continues to evolve to establish itself as a major tourist destination through adapting the local population, exhibiting free and accessible art, and developing different retail and residential aesthetics. The community attempts to balance its bohemian identity with becoming a more affluent and homogenous community, which ironically is driving out the diverse community that inspired the artistic, outspoken nature of Venice. The community continues to pay tribute to its artistic origins by organizing public art festivals and preserving and promoting murals throughout the community to attract people seeking a bohemian and carefree environment. Differences between the upscale shopping on Abbot Kinney Boulevard and the casual ambiance of Venice Boardwalk as well as differences in residential areas illustrate Venice’s struggle to adapt to tourism and preserve its origins.
          
A key aspect of being an appealing community for tourists to feel comfortable exploring is to be one that has the marks of a traditionally “safe” neighborhood. Safe neighborhoods in the United States are often marked by being white dominant, educated households, and economically being part of the middle or upper class.

Venice Census Data Showing Age, Ethnicity, Education, and Income.
   {:.caption}
Venice’s population today has a clear alignment with the commonly desired aspects of an American community. Sixty-four-point two percent of the population is white, has a relatively high average household income within Los Angeles County, and 49.3% of residents 25 years and older have a four-year degree. Because of this, it is an area that many people would feel comfortable exploring on their own and to stay at during a vacation. White dominant communities are important to people as it is a common but not accurate form of measuring the safety of an area. Furthermore, education and higher than average household wealth demonstrates that people residing in the area are aligned with many tourists’ opinions of an educated, lawful, and moral community. Additionally, the population is predominantly young or middle-aged adults.  This age group demonstrates that most of the community is of working age. Therefore, they can afford to live in the unique, more expensive, and tourist driven area of Venice.
          
Along with the composition of a neighborhood’s residential population, the appeal of an area is also influenced by the levels of homelessness. As I explored Venice, the boardwalk was swarming with tourists, the Venice canals had families going on weekend strolls and tourists photographing the unique area, and there were no homeless tents anywhere. In fact, I only saw a handful of homeless people gathered in one alleyway adjacent to the boardwalk. In contrast to my hometown of Seattle where public lands are open for the homeless to stay and there are numerous homeless camps under bridges, along highways, and in public parks, it was surprising to see such few homeless people in an area that has many tourists who could afford to donate money and in an area that is expensive to pay for housing. Los Angeles County has however implemented regulations to prevent public spaces to become “potential sites of refugee for homeless people” by forbidding “sleeping on the beach, or in vehicles on public streets, or in tents, or engaging in other activities associated with homelessness [including disrobing, bathing, or shaving in public]” (Law, Robin). Consequently, much of LA County has made it burdensome to be homeless. While this helps to mitigate the presence of homelessness in many tourist destinations like Venice, it also does not aid the homeless situation. Communities are pushing homeless-related issues to other neighborhoods when they should be implementing housing and shelter solutions for them instead. Many of the regulations targeted at removing homelessness can be seen throughout the community on street signs and residential sites.

The “Residential Quiet Zone” sign is not only prohibiting camping sites but also is preventing street vendors. This is ironic because it is attempting to separate the residential area on the boardwalk from the bohemian nature of Venice, which is a quintessential element of Venice’s appeal to tourists. Additionally, many residential areas, especially those close to the beach, have many signs with the common message of “stay out.” This further demonstrates the community’s hostility towards homelessness and perhaps suggests that there are issues with homeless people attempting to reside in public and private areas throughout the neighborhood. Overall, Los Angeles County and Venice have implemented many regulation and cultural standards in order to eliminate homeless people so that the neighborhood appears to be wealthier, safer, and more controlled to tourists.

While being a safe place for nonlocals to navigate is important, Venice stands out from the other beachfront neighborhoods throughout California because of its lively and unusual bohemian atmosphere. Along the boardwalk, there is an abundance of street performers, individual non-corporate vendors, and outdoor activities. Venice has a history of being a free spirited and expressive community as it was a “beatnik culture in 1950s, became an active hippy and political community in the 1960s, and emerged as an artist enclave in 1970s” (Deer). The community strives to keep their unique atmosphere by maintaining “anticorporate” ideals for their brands (Deer). This ideal for freedom of expression within the community has inspired a unique atmosphere that stands out from the structured, metropolitan environments of areas like Los Angeles City, San Jose, and San Francisco. Venice’s “free-spirited, anti-materialistic and inclusive nature” created by the “famed Muscle Beach outdoor gym, funky shops for souvenirs, street buskers, mimes to musicians and everything in between” made it an escape from the “homogenized, celebrity-obsessed, plasticized culture of Los Angeles” (McGrath). However, the eclectic and diverse scene at Venice is being threatened by the rise of “upscale boutiques, coffee bars, high-priced homes and gentrification” (McGrath). Although the initial attraction of Venice to tourists was characterized by its unique bohemian nature, the neighborhood now is struggling to balance becoming a more upscale, expensive, and trendy area with preserving its original artistic and diverse background.   
           
As a neighborhood that was shaped by the artists living in the community, Venice continues to mark itself as a center of art and expression through attracting visitors with its art festivals. Not only do local businesses have murals along their exterior walls, but they also choose to engage in public art festivals as it is a major way to gain shoppers and visitors. By hosting art festivals, Venice is continuing to develop its presence as an “artists enclave” and a place of free expression. Art festivals have become an essential part of Venice’s tourism attracting “30,000 people each year” (Deener). Venice Art Walk, an event were visitors can see artist’s workspaces and projects, emphasizes Venice’s narrative as “influential[ly] artistic” while also drawing people into the neighborhood and retail areas (Deener). Through creating events like the Venice Art Walk, Venice is able to attract artist to continue to share their art – in shops, events, or street forms – throughout the neighborhood allowing Venice to continue to grow its collection of murals, vendors, and street artists. Furthermore, by attracting people who appreciate the self-expression and carefree nature of art, Venice continues to represent the diverse group of people who built the bohemian culture. It also promotes households who share the same values as people who attend these art festivals to want to reside in the neighborhood, which further allows Venice to preserve its bohemian roots. Another art festival that occurs at Venice beach is the Venice Beach Music Fest which is an annual free event that is sponsored by local and national businesses including “Venice Beach Suites and Hotel, Royal Gold Potting Soil, The Sidewalk Café, Volcano Tea House, Marriott Marina Del Ray, Venice Boardwalk Association” and many more (“Venice Beach Music Fest Music and Arts Festival”). A number of hotels including Venice Beach Suites and Hotel and Marriot Marina Del Ray help sponsor this major festival because it attracts tourists to visit and stay on their properties. Additionally, smaller business like The Sidewalk Café and Volcano Tea House also choose to invest in this event because the festival draws tourists to their retail spaces. Art festivals are essential to tourism in Venice as it drives art inclined tourists and residents to preserve the artistic origins of the neighborhood.
          
In addition to art festivals, Venice continues to incorporate art by having a variety of murals on display throughout residential areas, retailers, and public spaces. Venice’s abundance of artwork displayed throughout the neighborhood makes it a very trendy, contemporary, and lively place to explore. In fact, Venice has a “Tour of Venice Murals” that was created by the Social and Public Art Resource Center (SPARC) dedicated to preserve Venice’s community and the muralists’ legacies (Stowell). Organizations like SPARC work to preserve Venice’s image as a center for artists. Doing so, allows Venice to keep its public artworks so that the values and aesthetics of the community endure. Murals around Venice are present in visible and accessible areas.

These murals are both for aesthetics – especially on hotels, which have images of the sunset and beaches painted alongside their exterior walls – and to spread messages like the “Endangered Species” mural. Venice embraces its quirky and bohemian nature by having an abundance of colorful, meaningful, or visually pleasing murals throughout its neighborhood. By having a plethora of public murals, Venice has differentiated itself from other communities allowing it to maintain its uniqueness and attraction to tourism.
           
One of the most apparent changes in Venice was the development of Abbot Kinney Boulevard. Since its reformation from being West Washington Boulevard, it has grown into an upscale shopping area that has attracted media attention and drawn tourists to the neighborhood. The street has fostered a drastically different ambiance within this section of the community from the Venice Beach Boardwalk. Abbot Kinney Blvd used to be filled with “small-scale stores, political organizations, a neighborhood newspaper, nonprofit agencies, artist studios, and thrift stores” but it has since shifted from being a “multifunctional social space” to having a “central retail theme” (Deener). The street transformed from being a social hub for the local community to express their ideas and to develop intimate relationships to becoming a major tourist attraction. Moreover, this transformation has caused many locals to be displaced because the community transitioned to becoming more expensive, so they can no longer afford to own businesses on the street or afford shop there. In response to the displacement of the original residents, activists from different racial and economic backgrounds have advocated for more affordable housing and the protection of low-income residents (Deener). Transitioning a community from one directed to nurturing and supporting the residents to one that prioritizes its attraction to tourists makes it impractical and unfeasible for original families to continue to live there because of the increased costs. Changes in spaces like that of Abbot Kinney Blvd prevent economic and racial diversity causing it to become an affluent white community. Consequently, the neighborhood has adapted to become “safer” in the eyes of tourists as well.
More authentic to the bohemian and diverse culture of Venice’s origins is the Venice Beach Boardwalk. The beachside is convenient for people to walk or bike around as it is bordering numerous restaurants, shops, hotels, and residential areas. Additionally, the beaches foster an ideal environment for visitors as it has a plethora of recreational areas like outdoor gyms, beach volleyball nets, and a skate park.

Beaches are a major part of Los Angeles County’s tourism drawing about 53,000,000 visitors annually. Venice has a major impact on this trend, drawing over 8,000,000 visitors annually (Dwight). In order to be attracting the most visitors out of all the beaches in Los Angeles County, Venice needs to appeal to the safety standards and have unique traits that elevate the neighborhood to be the most desirable travel hotspot. Venice beach’s origins as being a bohemian, free spirited, and diverse community is reflected by those on the boardwalk.

From a variety of merchandise, experience with art, and socioeconomic backgrounds of sellers, the boardwalk has enough variety to attract people with various interests. While Venice has preserved some aspects of its original character in the boardwalk, it is important to recognize that the diverse bohemian aspects are not located with a guarantee on permanence like the established upscale stores on Abbot Kinney Blvd are.
          
The clear division within retail areas can also be seen in the division of residential styles throughout the neighborhood. While exploring the community, many of the houses either had unique personalized designs or were older duplexes or apartments. It was a neighborhood unlike other areas I have previously experienced, which have houses with similar designs with a typical American family community. Abbot Kinney, a real estate developer whom Abbot Kinney Blvd is named after, went as far as to digging canals to create a resort like community for wealthy individuals – essentially wanting to develop a Venice, Italy in California (Friedersdor). The artificial canals lined with multimillion 3-bedroom homes has created a unique and beautiful environment for tourists to explore. However, it has also removed possible housing for low-income families as it was designed to be a luxurious living space for the wealthy. This demonstrates Venice prioritizing its positive image for tourists over the sustainability of the local community. Not only are property values high because of real estate developers like Abbot Kinney targeting wealthy demographics, but also because Venice is located on one of the “biggest pedestrian-friendly cityscapes… with almost perfect weather all year around” (Friedersdor). Venice beach provides an area that not only hippies and artists want to reside in to enjoy the relaxed environment of the waterfront and a beachside community, it is also a place that wealthy households want to transform into their own ideal living community. The transitions of retail spaces becoming more expensive and residential areas developed for the rich has accelerated the communal transition from the original diverse, cultural, and creative community to a community comprised of economic, racial, and social privilege.
          
Venice has compromised its original identity to become more attractive to tourism and is struggling to find ways to preserve its unique style and ambiance. High living costs and new developments in the neighborhood that make the neighborhood more seemingly “safe” to tourists has prevented the original diverse community from staying making Venice an increasingly white and wealthy community. By providing a variety of public and free art installments and events, Venice is attempting to connect with its bohemian and artistic origins. Through Venice’s s conflicting goals of preserving its original nature and becoming more attractive to tourism, the neighborhood’s residential styles and retail spaces have become increasingly divided. Venice continues to grow in attempt to become more attractive to tourism by reshaping the local community to become wealthier and whiter, providing public access to an abundance of art, and developing unique retail and residential areas. When communities are developing, how can low-income households advocate for what they need and want in their neighborhoods? Developers are less inclined to have their target consumer be poorer households because they won’t make as large of profits. Communities are pushing away their problems and displacing the homeless and low-income households because they are prioritizing the comfort and image that wealthy residents and tourists seek. So, what does this ultimately mean for individuals who don’t have the resources to get help and to what degree should neighborhoods like Venice be adapting to support them?
