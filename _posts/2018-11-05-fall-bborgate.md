Making a City: West Los Angeles
   
   West Los Angeles—a neighborhood that over the past 25 years experienced juristic changes in terms of poverty, demographics, and appearance—has caught the attention of many, including a local resident: “I lived in West LA … in the late 1970's. I look back at my years in West LA as some of the best of my life. As I still live on the Westside, I drive through West LA frequently and have seen the neighborhood change, in my view for the better” (Miguel, 2010). Primarily wealthy single young residents are immigrating to West Los Angeles transforming it into an expensive community with increasing safety and wellbeing while also shifting demographics. This movement creates controversy for two groups of people, the new residents being charged with the burden of bettering the community, and the existing residents experiencing a form of gentrification; being pushed out of their local neighborhood. The overall cost of living in West Los Angeles has been increasing since the mid 1990’s evident through real estate prices and average income increasing while the homeless population decreases. As new policies and actions are being implemented by upper-class residents, progress is being made in terms of the overall image and safety of the community. Census reports have shown a shift in the demographics of West Los Angeles, the neighborhood is becoming more educated, achieving higher incomes, and tending to value the family life less. 
 
   Over the past twenty years the cost of living in West Los Angeles has increased, subsequently altering the demographics of the neighborhood with an immigration of wealthier citizens and an exodus of individuals with modest means. Beginning in the mid 1990’s a select few studios moved from Hollywood to West Los Angeles, taking advantage of the vacant large warehouses that were previously used as factories. These factories were ideal for movie studios according to a realtor, “Creative firms like the unique buildings, and the more character the buildings have the better” (Newman, 1995). This move from Hollywood to West Los Angeles brought new types of jobs - jobs that paid well and incentivized wealthier people to the area, further changing culture. In a newspaper article published in November of 1995 the writer, Morris Newman, states that the current (1995) warehouse lease was $1.5 per square foot compared to the previous year (1994) at $0.90. This commercial real estate price increase, by almost double, has made these older buildings more appealing, causing the neighborhood to value and adopt a new architectural style. Residential real estate has accordingly followed suit of commercial, in terms of price increases and availability. Chief economist and vice president of Pacific Union International comments on the phenomenon, “How many areas around Los Angeles have homes selling for as much as 67% over asking price are the numbers buyers should pay attention to” (Selma Hepp, 2018). Moreover, in a Forbes article Ellen Paris shares that in the first half of 2018 home values in West Los Angeles have increased by 20% with only 11 houses being put on the market. Surprisingly, the events in 1995, such as the new jobs and immigration of wealthy people, and since have not plateaued, they continue to affect the altering identity of West Los Angeles. Also, with these increasing prices all around, families who have lived in the neighborhood can no longer afford to remain.

   The average income in West Los Angeles is increasing, again indicative of wealthier individuals moving in and molding the community’s culture. In a way that stereotypes against the poorer community and benefits themselves, the wealthy have altered the existing community. This trend of increasing wealth seems to be consistent with factory jobs being replaced by white collared jobs. In a study conducted by Point 2 Homes, West Los Angeles’s income has increased by 39% since 2000, and 10% since 2010 due to new jobs being made available. This substantial increase has raised the standards of living, allowing higher end restaurants, shops, and other commodities to enter the West Los Angeles economy. Because the new upper class in West Los Angeles prefer these upscale businesses and they can afford them, the options for people without an abundance of money to spend are becoming limited in scope. According to the same source, the average income of West Los Angeles rose at a more rapid rate than the city of Los Angeles. Los Angeles as a whole’s income has increased 35% since 2000 and 6% since 2010. The fact that West Los Angeles appears to be gaining status faster than greater Los Angeles area makes this neighborhood more appealing and ideal for people who can afford to move. Furthermore, to continue to make the neighborhood more desirable, clean up measures have been instituted to create order in the city.
 
   Another tell of a community’s well-being is linked to its homeless population, and in West Los Angeles statistics offer a promising argument of the community becoming more sustainable. California has been known to suffer greatly with the issue of homelessness, especially big cities that offer shelter, food, and guidance. Although systems like PATH aid homeless persons, not much progress is being made. Because the homeless population needs support to integrate, neighborhoods are left to deal with the issue. Many wealthy areas tend to pass legislature that removes the homeless from their area, such as hostile architecture and exile process. According to a graph (pictured to below) published by KCET, the homeless population in West Los Angeles decreased from 275 in 2017 to 160 in 2018, a difference of 115 people within a year.

A drop of 115 homeless persons cannot be considered progress in a community because these individuals did not overcome homelessness by reestablishing themselves in society; they simply moved to another neighborhood that offered a better environment for them. In another article written by Julianne Tveten, she referenced an interview conducted with a man, Adam Smith, concerning hostile architecture and homeless people. Smith tells the story of a group of homeless people whose camp became uninhabitable after a private company placed standalone planters where a homeless group previously set up camp, “That next day, after I saw [the planter boxes] for the first time, I went there to look around because I figured they were sleeping somewhere else. I found people up around the corner, just, like, a block away” (“No Walk in the Garden for the Urban Homeless”). This story further proves West Los Angeles intends on avoiding the problem of displaced individuals rather than working with the homeless population to find a solution beneficial to society, because they can afford to. It is important to realize that private organizations and individuals are also taking a part in creating landscapes that discriminate against the homeless, meaning it is a common goal, as a whole of West Los Angeles, to displace the homeless. It is common knowledge that the existence of homeless individuals is perceived as detrimental to the overall quality of that neighborhood as unsafe, ghetto, and poor. The issue arises, however, when a community cannot agree on the best solution to the problem at hand; many individuals desire the removal of displaced people out of convenience for themselves by avoiding the burden of help them regain self-sufficiency, both which will improve the community but not the greater Los Angeles area.

   In West Los Angeles, as wealthier people move in with intentions of further developing the community’s overall well-being, they focus on many key areas including crime management, visual appeal, and education. West Los Angeles, like many metropolises, experience high crime rates, resulting in the need for an elevated crime response system. Along with city legislatures and the LAPD, residents all share the same goal of keeping the streets safe from violence, and as neighborhoods become more affluent they become greater targets for crimes such as burglary and theft. In 2015 West Los Angeles experienced its first increase in crime, since 2003 focused on theft. After this increase, officials and Greg Davis, Burglary detective, responded by constructing special task forces to combat crime as well as increasing the size of the task force, “(Officers) are working undercover to catch people trying to break into cars, in underground structures or on the streets” (Davis). These measures taken prove that the people living in West Los Angeles are committed and determined to their goal of creating a West Los Angeles known for its wealth and saftey. Also mentioned in the article is the statistic that theft and burglary were among the crimes that increased the most in West Los Angeles. An increase in these related crimes is evident of a wealthy community. Officials are aware of the fact that wealthy communities breed burglary as they are targets known to possess many valuable items. Crime is just one of the many determinants of a prosperous community, other factors such the overall appearance are also looked at when assessing a community.

   The people currently living in West Los Angeles value creating and maintaining a decorative appearance because they possess the means to, unlike the previous occupants. Since West Los Angeles was primarily a factory blue collar neighborhood in the mid to late 20th century, scenery and image were not heavily prioritized. Now that the community has gained wealth, beautification is a luxury that is attainable. Local residents of West Los Angeles have the opportunity to apply and receive funding for beautification projects throughout the city made available through a grant consisting of over $850,000 in 2007. Although this funding is not directly coming from the residents, the grant has been made available through either lobbying on their behalf, which costs money, or their taxes given to the city council. Also, the community members privilege gives them the opportunity and free time to participate in the beatification movement. Moreover, the city is giving the residents the power to decide if and how they want to participate in this project, implying the city values its subordinates’ opinions. Beatification projects result in making an area more appealing all to make the community more appealing. Pictured below are luxury cars parked next to an older, well-maintained building.

The contrasting elements in this picture—the expensive foreign cars and the older refurbished building—are evidence of West Los Angeles’ history and current state. West Los Angeles culture has come to appreciate older rustic architecture, like the factories that are now film studios, and have worked to fix and maintain their appearances. As West Los Angeles becomes a safer and more beautiful community, other elements also follow, resulting in an ideal living area if affordable to the individual.   
   The demographics of West Los Angeles have recently become predominantly people with a higher education, single, and wealthy. This change can possibly be explained through a subtle campaign to push out ethnic and lower-class people. Los Angeles has a historical culture of being ethnically and economically diverse, with these groups being divided into neighborhoods throughout the city. West Los Angeles used to, up until the late 20th century, predominantly include an ethnic and poorer population, which is consequently related to education levels. According to census data, West Los Angeles’ percentage of citizens above 24 with a four-year degree is 60.4%, almost double the national average at 33.4%. The high rate of education these individuals earned is another factor that contributed to the revitalization of West Los Angeles. Coincidingly, with higher education average income also increases, and West Los Angeles’ average is 1.5 times greater the national. West Los Angeles’s shift from being a blue collar to an educated professional workforce within a span less than thirty years is rapid change and shows the determination the community possesses. Moreover, these statistics are not changing because current members are deciding to get a degree and a better paying job, but due to the people leaving and entering the community. As these new types people emigrate the values of the community change. 
American culture and society values family, but trends indicate that as societies become more prosperous, like in West Los Angeles, couples tend to create families later along in life. With a younger population that prioritizes job fulfillment and education, West Los Angeles appears to follow the national trend. The average household size in West Los Angeles is 1.9, again lower than the national average. Pictured below is a newly built apartment building in West Los Angeles.

This building was built out of demand for more housing in the community. The fact that apartments are being built rather than houses confirms the point mentioned above concerning small families. As well as smaller households, 52% of the adults are unmarried. The small family size and percent of unmarried people in West Los Angeles imply that these people value other aspects of life more than family, meaning they would not have an issue with moving from their home city and separating from their family. Moreover, this shows West Los Angeles is becoming a community where people move into to create their own life, rather than previously where generations established themselves. Pictured above is a newly built apartment building in West Los Angeles. This building was built out of demand for more housing in the community. The fact that apartments are being built rather than houses confirms the point mentioned above concerning small families. 

   The influx of a new type of population in West Los Angeles and the exodus of the previous residents, including homeless people, has given rise to the cost of living thus raising real estate prices. The obstacles West Los Angeles faces in order to reinvent itself required community members to become more active in the community, lobbying for new legislation, grants and safety measures. Redefined West Los Angeles has become appealing to a certain homogeneous demographic; individuals that tend to be educated, wealthy, and single. The betterment of the community in terms of wealth, safety and image and the new demographics has come at a cost, at the expense of people who have lived in West Los Angeles for generations who had to move due to financial burdens on behalf of the wealthy new neighbors. Although it can easily be agreed upon the benefits and improvements made through gentrifying the community and making it safer are a sign of progress, not all agree with the reinvention of. As a local Los Angeles resident puts it, “West LA, an area that once had some flavor and culture to it, with diversity abundant with its Hispanic, Japanese, and other residents. Now, thanks to gentrification and greedy landowners’ nice buildings that had character and memories to them are being knocked down for luxury condominiums” (Tom).
