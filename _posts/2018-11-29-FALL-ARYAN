Many of the communities in Los Angeles County bear distinct stereotypes. Compton? Gang affiliation and hip-hop. Little Tokyo? Immigrant-driven Japanese restaurants, shops, and culture. Beverly Hills? The epitome of comfort and luxury. North Hollywood? Not so easy to pin down. Part of the oft-mocked San Fernando Valley, the neighborhood commonly referred to as NoHo only recently began developing its own unique culture. To those not as familiar with the area, it resembles yet another unassuming residential district. But in the past two decades, it’s experienced an explosive growth in urban attractions. Due to its demographic shift from a predominantly white to highly diverse neighborhood in the late 1900s, as well as improvements in transportation, namely the expansion of the Metro system to the community, North Hollywood currently boasts a versatile culture of comfortable residential living mixed with an arts-rich urban charm. Near the end of the 20th century, an ethnic reversal swept North Hollywood along with many other traditionally white suburban towns throughout the nation. The shift in demographics succeeded in transforming the area from a largely homogeneous, model bedroom community into a more diverse town with a new culture of upward mobility among minorities. About a decade later, NoHo again changed drastically with the extension of the Metro system to the community, growing in terms of housing, population, and urban amenities. Today, these influences blend to form a North Hollywood home to a thriving arts district, a diverse population, and a unique mix of residential and urban living.

For most of the 20th century, North Hollywood was characterized as a quiet and stable suburban community with little cultural or ethnic diversity. Like many Los Angeles towns, North Hollywood’s foundations were built on agriculture. In the late 19th century, an farming group led by Isaac Lankershim took over management of the property, kickstarting its development into a small farming town that was eventually named Lankershim in 1896. With the housing boom of the early 1900s, however, the town began its track towards urbanization. Lankershim was renamed to North Hollywood in 1927 “in an effort to capitalize on the glamour of Hollywood in the land and real-estate boom.” Especially “as the aviation industry developed in Burbank and naval and air force members fell in love with California in World War 2,” the area attracted many working class families, transforming from a small agricultural town into a strong suburban community. While larger in population and economically healthy by this point, NoHo was still largely viewed as a simple bedroom community in the mid 1900s, a far cry from its current reputation of vibrance and variety. What the community had in economic and social stability it lacked in culture, devoid of any unique attractions or customs. In addition to its lack of cultural depth, North Hollywood remained ethnically homogenous for much of the 20th century. Like the rest of the San Fernando Valley, in which the town resides, it was “designed to be a community of homeowners, overwhelmingly white and middle class.” In fact, “as recently as the 1960s, about nine out of ten Valley residents were Caucasian.” Typical to the American postwar era, NoHo epitomized white, suburban comfort during its period of urban development in the first half of the 1900s. This lack of ethnic and social diversity made the community a safe but relatively uninteresting spot in terms of outside appeal. It wasn’t until the changes of the late 20th century that the neighborhood began its departure from majority white suburbia to the more eclectic community most are familiar with today.

One of the most notable of these changes was the movement of new immigrants into the suburbs in the 1970s and 80s, a nationwide phenomenon that swept North Hollywood and helped develop its diverse, working class culture. As opposed to the strict segregation observed in the years following World War II, the seventies brought on a wave of immigrant and minority settlement in formerly white-dominated suburbs across America. Initiated by the school integration and blockbusting that swept African Americans out of inner cities, the suburbs quickly replaced its Caucasian inhabitants with ethnic minorities. The national change was especially evident in the San Fernando Valley and North Hollywood, which saw a huge spike in “middle-class minorities and upwardly mobile, recent immigrants” during the time period. This demographic switch transformed the perfectly uniform bedroom community of NoHo into one of a more equal middle-class ambition. People of color previously separated from white suburbia were now looking for chances to settle in affordable homes and find stable sources of income, a cultural aspect still extremely prevalent in the NoHo community today. By 2000, North Hollywood had dropped to 55.2% white and increased to 51.2% Hispanic, 5% black, and 7.3% Asian or Pacific Islander. These statistics demonstrate a drastic shift from the Caucasian presence that dominated the neighborhood and surrounding San Fernando Valley in the postwar years. Not only did the sudden influx of minorities transform the culture of economic mobility for people of color, but it also diversified the population in general, creating a wider set of cultural customs compared to the general homogeneity of the 50s and 60s. In general, the demographic changes of the late 1900s resulted in a diversifying and cultural transformation of North Hollywood.

In addition to the transformative effects of the 1970s ethnic shift, one of the most impactful events on North Hollywood’s development was the improvement of transportation in the area, particularly the addition of the Metro Red Line in 2000. Los Angeles’ drastic population growth prompted the city council to push for construction of improved public transit in the mid 1900s, the first rail line to open being the Metro Blue Line in 1990. The system didn’t reach North Hollywood for a good while, leaving it largely isolated from the rest of the city. When the a Metro Red Line station was added in North Hollywood in 2000, however, the neighborhood experienced an explosive growth. Longtime NoHo resident Luis Ordaz, who grew up in the area in the 1990s, observed the drastic changes in the community that the new transportation brought firsthand: “Metro made North Hollywood cool; it made it hip and a desirable place to live so much so that our snobbish L.A. cousins on the Westside no longer turn up their noses at the prospect of crossing over to our side of town. Hell, some now even entertain the thought of living in The Valley!"

With this new ease of access to the area, NoHo became not only a comfortable community to live in for those seeking upward opportunity, but also a fun visitor destination. The addition of the Metro kickstarted the growth of countless housing units, restaurants, shops, and other venues. In fact, the period from 2000 to 2009 saw a large spike in housing built in North Hollywood, as well as a large population increase: the neighborhood was home to 77,848 in 2000, but this number increased to 87,241 by 2008. The addition of a fast, easy way to get to NoHo is likely to have encouraged many developers to build in the North Hollywood area, as its increased accessibility makes it a more desirable place to live. This increased amount of housing, together with the new venues built in the neighborhood, subsequently draws in a larger amount of residents, thus explaining the population increase since 2000. Overall, the expansion of the Metro Red Line made NoHo much more connected to its surrounding neighborhoods, initiating a period of extreme growth in both physical attractions and population.

This immediate growth sparked by the addition of the Metro also contributed to one of the most unique characteristics of NoHo today: its mixture of easy, residential living and exciting urban culture. As discussed previously, North Hollywood spent a long while as a simple suburban community - it was a good, quiet place to find affordable housing, but its attractions stopped there. When shops, restaurants, and other venues began popping up with the development brought by the Metro, however, the neighborhood’s new urban amenities intertwined with its existing suburban lifestyle to create a mixed culture not seen much elsewhere in L.A. In an article from L.A. Weekly, Adam Gropman explores this unique culture, explaining how “North Hollywood has a refreshing mix of people” who have “chosen NoHo because they like the semi-suburban lifestyle…but they want urban amenities, too.” It’s “the perfect mix of modern, bustling L.A. and unpretentious, working-class suburbia.” The “unpretentious” and “working-class” aspects of NoHo’s culture can likely be largely attributed to the migration wave of the 70s and 80s. As stated earlier, this overhaul of the traditionally white neighborhood kickstarted a new culture of upward economic mobility, one that has evidently remained a notable quality of the community today. The newer “urban amenities,” on the other hand, came with the addition of the Metro Red Line, offering existing residents affordable excursions and drawing in plenty of new visitors as well. Arm in arm, the ethnic shift of the late 1900s and the public transit improvements at the turn of the century have contributed to create the blended culture that NoHo is known for today.

Beside their effects on the urban development of North Hollywood, the recent changes in demographics and transportation have also strengthened the cultural diversity of the neighborhood. The ethnic makeup of a community typically has a prominent effect on the customs and venues in the surrounding area - take Little Tokyo, Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia, or Little Ethiopia, all also part of L.A. County. For decades, North Hollywood held no defining cultural moment besides its overwhelming Caucasian population. That is, until the increase in diversity of the late 20th century prompted the growth of various cultural shops, restaurants, and other locales. When praising the food scene in NoHo, Gropman details the diverse cultural options available, including “dynamite fast Indian food,” “authentic Latin American offerings,” as well as “real, neighborhoody Middle Eastern, Armenian, and Thai restaurants.” The movement of ethnic minorities into North Hollywood clearly had an impact on its urban attractions. These groups were likely able to capitalize on the explosion in retail development initiated by the Metro Red Line, making their own mark on the community with ethnic-inspired stores and eateries. So unlike many other areas home to concentrated populations of a single demographic, North Hollywood houses a wide range of ethnicities, a spread strongly reflected in its urban scene.

Perhaps the biggest hallmark of current NoHo culture is its thriving arts district, a clear embodiment of the neighborhood’s diversity and versatility. North Hollywood has long held ties to the performing arts, its beginnings dating back to the construction of the El Portal Theatre in the 1920s. In the late 1900s, the town’s connection to theatre grew even stronger with the establishment of the successful Actors Forum Theatre. However, the NoHo Arts District that many are familiar with today didn’t begin its growth until 2000, when longtime California resident Nancy Bianconi helped organize an arts festival in collaboration with the opening of the Metro Red Line station. The event ended up attracting almost 500,000 people, and Bianconi rode the momentum to develop the small art community in NoHo, soon launching a website to supplement its growth: NoHoArtsDistrict.com. Bianconi’s arts festival is one of the most direct effects of the opening of the Metro in North Hollywood. After realizing the success of this conjoined event, she was able to further expand the arts community by capitalizing on the development started by NoHo’s improvements in public transportation. Similar to the increase in cultural shops and restaurants, the arts district just so happens to be another urban project swept up in the Metro’s growth.

Change first started to creep into the quiet neighborhood of North Hollywood near the end of the 20th century, when it became home to a much larger population of ethnic minorities. The subsequent transformative effects on the community’s culture were then heightened even more with the groundbreaking opening of the Metro Red Line in 2000. Today, NoHo is simultaneously an affordable, working-class suburban town and a bustling hub of arts and urban life. These two primary changes - demographics and transportation - are arguably the most influential factors on North Hollywood’s current, unique culture. So although it might not be notorious for its wealth and luxury like Beverly Hills, or saturated with a single culture like KTown or Little Tokyo, North Hollywood’s ever-developing versatility makes it one of the most interesting to look out for. Especially considering its drastic transformation in recent decades, who knows where the next few years will take it?
