Strolling along Santa Monica Boulevard for the first time, I immediately noticed the scintillating rainbow-colored crosswalks. As a gay young man from a conservative Utah community, the outwardly LGBTQ+ atmosphere of West Hollywood was both thrilling and alarming to me. But as a middle-class Korean-American, I simultaneously felt alienated by the ritzy designer shops and lack of asian representation. Even the rainbow-colored paint—emblematic of West Hollywood’s inclusive principles—is fading, perhaps indicative of a neighborhood that is not quite as progressive as it once was. Still, with an ebullient atmosphere and liberal politics, West Hollywood is revered as an LGBTQ+ oasis and homeless refuge, with racial diversity presumably comparable to the Greater Los Angeles area. Despite this romanticization of West Hollywood as an impeccable progressive haven, the neighborhood’s dissipating gay identity, subtle animosity to the homeless, and paucity of racial diversity have fostered a paradoxical situation in which the actual living standards and demographics fall short of the neighborhood’s avant-garde history and inclusive values. The “gayborhood” facade of bygone years is concealing the turmoil of gentrification, as the gay community steadily vacates the city. Similarly, the assertion of West Hollywood as a homeless sanctuary is camouflaging the escalating tension between the homeless population and the city’s residents. West Hollywood’s increasing exclusivity is epitomized by the homogenous racial demographics of the area, which reflect an appalling absence of diversity.

West Hollywood’s significance as a symbol of inclusion solidified after the city’s municipal incorporation in 1984 and the subsequent revamping of the area’s social scene by gay residents. The city’s incorporation “lent legal legitimization to gay identity,” a convenience that gays valued more than a deluxe lifestyle (Forest 137). Thus, gays congregated at the downmarket urban outpost, refurbishing the area with vibrant nightlife, bold aesthetics, and nonconforming culture. West Hollywood became an archetypal gay village for two primary reasons: the original site was economical and urbanized. Regardless of the perception of gay affluence—largely perpetuated by the upscale nature of neighborhoods like West Hollywood—there is a prevalent sexual orientation wage gap, with incomes for behaviorally gay and bisexual men between 11% and 27% less than their straight counterparts (Antecol et al. 519). Thus, it would be troublesome for an area with an exorbitant cost of living to attract gay residents. Explaining the LGBTQ+ need for an urban home, Brenden Michaels, a queer individual who moved from rural Oregon to New York, said ‘“As a queer person in America growing up in the country, I did not find rural areas to be safe, welcoming or financially viable”’ (O’Sullivan). With West Hollywood providing a functionally inclusive and affordable urban space, LGBTQ+ residents steadily revitalized the area’s cultural liveliness. 
	
Despite being at the vanguard of West Hollywood’s gentrification, the gay community is now being dismissed from their own gay neighborhood. While Santa Monica Boulevard is still defined by its iconic rainbow crosswalks and multitude of gay bars, the brightly colored paint is growing dull and numerous gay-themed entertainment centers are being replaced by more modest attractions. LGBTQ+ communities are renovating neighborhoods only to be displaced themselves. This cyclical phenomenon is not unique to West Hollywood; nearly identical social and demographic shifts were witnessed in Alphabet City, New York, and London, England, among others. As affluence increases, interest peaks among straight and wealthy consumers, who inundate the community, first as a “puke-and-leave drinking destination,” then as a permanent home (James). While heterosexual gentrifiers face similar issues, the disappearance of gay villages is saddening not only because an idiosyncratic culture is lost, but also because gay villages are few and far between. The spirit of homosexual normalcy is lost as LGBTQ+ residents are dislodged from their own community.
	
In West Hollywood, this dislodgment takes the form of in-state migration, with many residents moving to increasingly gay areas such as Echo Park, which has significantly more affordable housing prices. Frequent migration of the gay community is intuitive; gay couples are less likely to be tied-town to a particular location because it is relatively difficult to have children. In West Hollywood, the average persons per household from 2012 to 2016 was 1.60 (U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: West Hollywood City, California), highlighting the immense presence of gay community. But as gay individuals move out, the rapidly gentrifying neighborhood is losing its “notorious gay bathhouses…seedy massage parlors…[and] funky counter-culture boutiques” to activities catering to wealthy, straight customers (Conder). The housing market is being severely affected, as prices skyrocket to values definitively unattainable by most incomes. From August 2015 to August 2018, the median housing sales price jumped approximately 26%, from $674,500 to $850,000 (Real Estate Data for West Hollywood). Rent expenses are demonstrating a similar upward trend, causing young residents to be priced out of the neighborhood. Since young people tend to be progressive, the neighborhood is losing its grasp on the animated liberalness that led to its establishment. With the newfound pervasiveness of upscale restaurants, deluxe furniture stores, and “million dollar cookie-cutter condos,” gay residents aren’t experiencing the same homey, hipster atmosphere that attracted them to West Hollywood decades ago (Conder). The quintessential gay village is transforming into an eastward extension of Beverly Hills.
	
The assimilation of West Hollywood’s gay identity into broader Californian culture is a microcosm for cultural shifts across the developed world. Despite the negative connotations, vanishing gay neighborhoods can be considered a triumph since it signals the end of de facto segregation based on sexual orientation. While gays originally had to congregate in a select few urban sanctuaries, a number of cities are becoming increasingly progressive, attracting gay residents. The expanding geographic scope of gay culture can also be attributed to the expeditious development of the Internet, which provides ample opportunities for gays to meet prior to face-to-face interaction through apps such as Grinder and Jack’d. However, for many people, letting go of a city’s distinctive gay culture is “as hard as it is liberating, as saddening as it is invigorating” (Sullivan). For those who faced now-inconceivable social malevolence as a result of their homosexual identity, the idiosyncratic culture of their gay neighborhoods is “an integral part” of who they are (Sullivan). Gay neighborhoods have monumental influences on their residents; the atmosphere of inclusion allows people of all sexualities to embody repressed aspects of their personality. Often times, the newfound freedom cultivates gender extremities as residents fully embrace their liberty and subversively renounce antagonizing societal norms. With gay villages playing an extensive role in the lives of residents, the nostalgia felt for bygone West Hollywood is understandable. But given the choice between “a culture built on oppression and culture built on freedom, the decision is an easy one” (Sullivan 2005). While the disintegration of West Hollywood’s gay identity can be demoralizing to longtime residents, the phenomenon actually reflects a more tolerant social climate.
	
In Figure 1, street art illustrating a vintage typewriter, WRDSMTH—a Los Angeles street artist known for his impassioned, inspiring text—wrote a message to the city of West Hollywood with astonishing relevance to the LGBTQ+ community: “Do something every day to remind this city why the hell you’re here.” If the gay community takes for granted having an assembly of LGBTQ+ individuals contributing to a vivacious entertainment-based community, they will gradually be replaced by affluent, straight residents. Considering that there are no monetary benefits to retaining inexpensive entertainment, the eccentric, hole-in-the-wall shops and bars will be replaced as well. Thus, LGBTQ+ activism—through pride parades or by simply repainting the rainbow crosswalks—is essential in retaining the quirky hospitality of historical West Hollywood.
	
Despite the understated struggles of the gay community in West Hollywood, the homeless population is faring far worse, largely a result of apathetic, or even antagonistic, sentiments expressed through the neighborhood’s street design. West Hollywood is considered to be a homeless sanctuary by governing officials, yet the city’s treatment of the homeless is lackluster at best, egregious at worst. During the city’s progression from a low-market gay village to an upscale entertainment district, the city’s street design became increasingly unsympathetic to the homeless population. The neighborhood exclusively caters to upper-class comfort; there is absolutely no perceivable benevolence towards the homeless in the master plan of Santa Monica Boulevard. In the plenitude of dining options lining Santa Monica Boulevard, railings and fences disconnect the festive dining area from the sidewalk, fostering “bubbles of activity” along the street (Ehrenfeucht). The barriers around the bars and restaurants—along with incessantly patronizing stares and stigmatizing treatment—reinforce the growing culture of exclusion, as the homeless feel deplorable and unwelcome in their own neighborhood. In promoting West Hollywood as a city, governing officials attempt to portray a “certain commodified aesthetic and social image;” opulent restaurants are part of this “projected imagery,” but obvious indigence is not (Petty 71). The homeless, clearly detrimental to West Hollywood’s high-class facade, are driven away by the inhospitable atmosphere and criminalization of their innocuous activities, such as sitting on the sidewalk. As wealthy residents continue to flood the city, the homeless are increasingly seen as inconveniences to high-end lifestyles, rather than another group attempting to make West Hollywood their home. 
	
Adding fuel to the fire, hostile architecture—urban design used to deter certain targeted demographics from using public space—is rampant in West Hollywood, especially for urban rough sleepers, the primary victims of such architecture. Emblematic of an artistic and exquisite city, flowers, trees, and expressive street art pervade every road and alleyway. But these aesthetics, considered to be a “reliable litmus test for the overall health and ‘quality’” of the city “ossifies a concern with surface over substance, clean appearance over informed or effective policy” (Petty 71). Rather than addressing the root of the problem, street design is used to aggressively command the homeless migrate to other areas of Los Angeles, mirroring the demands of increasingly wealthy residents. For example, the entire city features a shortage of public benches, but even existing public benches have metal bars segmenting them. Marketed as an “armrest,” these segments actually just deter the homeless from sleeping on the benches. Similarly, curved and slanted seating is publicized as à la mode—synonymous with the city’s artistic image—although the design simply ensures a restless night’s sleep. Furthermore, public bathrooms are locked overnight to exclude the homeless, indirectly resulting in feces on residents’ lawns and even more tension between landowners and the homeless. This tension sparks the creation of more “exclusionary mechanisms…introduced on behalf of the public and… framed as necessary to combat disorder, deviant behaviours and the potential for crime” (Petty 72). This begins a vicious cycle that concludes with complete displacement of the homeless community.  In reality, much of the so-called “disorder” and “deviant behavior” are harmless endeavors, such as begging for money. West Hollywood’s social and political ineptitude regarding the homeless is reflected by the disconnect between the idealized progressive image of the neighborhood and the unenlightenment of their solutions.
	
Although homeless stigmatization and hostile architecture is prevalent in West Hollywood, the city’s core values of empathy and inclusion have led to homeless initiatives that are far more charitable than other Los Angels neighborhoods. Jake Weinraub, a mental health clinician at the Los Angles LGBT Center, works tirelessly connecting homeless individuals to the multitude of organizations available in West Hollywood, such as Ascencia and the Tarzana Treatment Center (The West Hollywood Homeless Initiative). However, despite these philanthropic ventures, the current services are insufficient to resolve the issue, as made clear by an analysis of Figure 3, a piece of street art piece by an artist called Thrash. 
	
Thrash’s art piece makes a statement condemning youth’s infatuation with technology, but the seemingly negligible graffiti of another artist changes the piece’s theme. The centered silhouette is wearing a hood, slouching his back, and tilting his head downward, all indicating complete absorption in his phone and apathy toward his surroundings. The shadowy form foreshadows the darkening of the world as a result. Warped and childish, the piece’s font highlights the satirical nature of the work; people blame society for their addiction to technology, when in reality, they are at fault. However, this message is altered by the minuscule orange text—accentuated by its acute contrast with the black spray paint—reading “homeless lives matter.” The addition of this statement completely changes the meaning of the work from a critique on the technological focus of today’s youth to their activism in support of groups in need, such as the homeless. Still, the satirical essence remains, ridiculing the previous artwork for degrading the youth, when in actuality, young people are at the forefront of societal progress. The words “blame it on the algorithm” also take on new meaning, now referring to the algorithmic plight of the homeless due to societal values, which have always marginalized transient individuals. Services need to be markedly improved to combat peoples’ intrinsic aversion to the homeless. As West Hollywood gentrifies, negative sentiments have intensified, causing the homeless to face an unfriendly atmosphere that develops in most high-end areas. 
	
West Hollywood’s semblance of inclusion is also contradicted by the area’s absence of racial diversity, which often prevents minorities from feeling welcomed in their home city. The greater Los Angeles area is incredibly diverse; only 28.5% of people are white alone (not hispanic or latino) and 48.6% of people are hispanic or latino (U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Los Angeles City, California). This radically contrasts with West Hollywood, where the population is a whopping 74.2% white alone (not hispanic or latino) and only 11.8% hispanic or latino (U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: West Hollywood City, California). These statistics clearly do not reflect West Hollywood’s hospitable values. When a city is dominated by one racial group, namely whites, minority groups are often treated like a token of their ethnic background and frequently stereotyped. With America’s history of racial segregation, “white people and others often stigmatize anonymous black persons by associating them with the putative danger, crime and poverty of the iconic ghetto” (Anderson). With whites racially predominant in West Hollywood, blacks in particular may feel alone in conquering the inevitable prejudice and racial insensitivity of whites living in a homogenous community. Further, black people are constantly apprehensive, prepared to face both blatant racism—such as the aggressive, racist tirade outside Pavilions, a West Hollywood grocery store—and clandestine malice. The struggles of minorities in homogenous areas often leads to uneasiness that is inconceivable among members of the racial majority.
	
Among gay people of color, the reality of West Hollywood is even more heartbreaking and routinely leads to their disillusionment. In a study involving the examination of gay minorities, interviewees were asked about their experiences in the “gayborhood” of West Hollywood. One Asian man said that:
I moved to West Hollywood, because I thought it would be like a more accepting neighborhood to be in. I stayed there for like over a year, almost, I think, a year-and-a-half. I moved out because, of course, the rent is expensive, and also it was exactly the opposite of what I thought it would be. Like I really thought it would be more accepting, but yet people do see you like what you are. Like what you look like, what color of your skin is. And your look is really important in West Hollywood, and being a minority, you know, majority of people that live there are like white (Han).

For many, the reality of West Hollywood’s culture falls drastically short of glorified expectations. Frequently, Asians, African Americans, Latinos, and other minorities arrive at gay villages hoping to escape the homophobia of their ethnic cultures, but are instead met with racism leaving them feeling alienated in either community. With a lack of representation in West Hollywood, minorities strive to develop an identity that “reaffirm[s] their sense of self-worth, or at least defuse[s] threats to their self-worth, specifically within the experiences that they have within a largely white ‘gay community’” (Han). However, when white men offensively specify their lack of interest in minority groups on gay dating or hookup apps, the self-deprecation of minorities is inevitable. The carnal bias toward white men is only one example of flagrant, often ignored, racism in the gay community. While unrealistic expectations always result in disappointment, insensitivity of white LGBTQ+ communities to racial issues brings about unprecedented dispiritedness among minorities. 

The population of West Hollywood is wrongly portrayed as one “heavily publicised niche—affluent, usually white LGBTs—…representative of a whole spectrum of people,” a situation that causes a stark contradiction between the outside perception of West Hollywood and the city’s actual living conditions (O’Sullivan 2016). Although the gay community is vacating West Hollywood, the remaining bars and nightclubs are enough to perpetuate the city’s historically gay image. While past levels of inclusion have given the impression of a welcoming environment for the homeless, newly situated wealthy landowners feel threatened by their presence. Finally, the “heavily publicised niche” completely ignores racial minorities, who often feel excluded in the inclusive neighborhood. In many ways, the paradoxical situation of West Hollywood is similar to Jay Gatsby’s romanticization of his lover, Daisy Buchanan in The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald. After years of fantasizing about a reunion with Daisy, Gatsby reunites with her, but there “must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of [Gatsby’s] dreams—not through her own fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion”j.(Fitzgerald 95). Criticism of West Hollywood stems from the lofty standards set by progressive residents; despite the city’s dissolving gay identity, aversion to the homeless, and relative lack of diversity, the city has been wonderfully enlightening and inclusive throughout the years—truly a dynamic exemplar of a vibrant city.
