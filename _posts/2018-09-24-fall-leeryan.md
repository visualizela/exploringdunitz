Before seeing Venice as "The Beverly Hills of the Ocean," the struggle that minorities faced when the town was founded and decades afterwards is crucial to understanding the community's racial development today.  From Venice’s historical problems, it is apparent why the town became famous and modernized the way it has.  Venice is a divided beach community that promotes white affluence and pushes out poorer minorities; the drive toward superiority is made evident in the town’s history, demographics, and environment.  Historically, resources, gang violence, and income change have all led to the gentrification of minorities in Venice while demographics of race and migration illustrate the racial component of White superiority.  The community's wealthy versus poor neighborhoods are reflected by commercial infrastructure, street mural art, and citizen responses to Venice’s development.

A key feature in the history of Venice dates back to 1929 when oil was first discovered in the community, thus bringing out citizens from economic turmoil but later on leading the town into environmental degradation.  The presence of oil seemed to be a way out of the suffering during the Great Depression for many low income residents.  The industry was perceived to be what would stabilized the town’s economy with Ohio Oil Company building a well that produced 3000 barrels of oil a day.  By 1931, “Venice oil field was the 4th most productive field in the state with 340 wells in use” (Carlson, 2015).  However, the locals didn’t know that the cause of their momentary prosperity would also lead to Venice’s downfall making way for wealthy groups to emerge from the submerged town.  The beach town now had to take into consideration environmental and safety issues that had not been apparent before.  This included the flooding lagoons, beach pollution, and even closing of schools due to unsafe environmental effects.  Venice, was known as the “Slum by the Sea” by the 1950s.  This was not just a metaphor for the economic problems occuring within Venice, but was a literal translation because of continued oil drilling.  Consequently, the government had to spend a decade “to get 48 million barrels of bubbling crude out of the shoreline” (Stanton, 1998).  The beach was a huge part of what made Venice attractive to its inhabitants.  By having periods when the population grew but no clean body of water for the masses to enjoy served as a tragedy and immediate complication that the city of Los Angeles had to deal with.  Contamination cleanup of the beach could go up to two million dollars, which is why the city had to spend tens of thousands more to study the soil.  With the government being focused on removing waste, appliances, and storage facilities, the lack of economic welfare of Venice serves as a constant reminder to citizens and the oil industry who used to receive a payroll of $75,000 a week that it was an end of era of oil prosperity (Stanton, 1998).  Additionally, Venice lacked tourism due to the uncleanliness of its beach which in turn hurt business owners - especially those located on the boardwalk.	
During the end of the financial disorder from the oil floods in Venice, gang activity sprung up, causing an influx of violence into a neighborhood of recovering individuals who wanted no more but a stable environment to live in.  When discussing gangs, it is impossible to ignore the area of Oakwood, which is “home of the Shoreline Crips, an African American gang that has engaged in wars with local Latino gangs” including the Venice 13 and even gangs from close neighborhoods like the Culver City Boys (Deener, 2007).  There was a war over crack cocaine and fear was the last thing the neighborhood needed as not only were people’s income at stake but their lives.  Most importantly it was the minority groups that needed an escape from gang culture, but instead were drawn in to it because of its sense of community and ownership. 

Ownership was also of the utmost importance at the time because it symbolized a huge part of many of the residents who lived in Venice for all their lives.  The residents who felt connected to the land would be individuals who lived on the wealthy side of Venice such as places like Abbot Kinney Boulevard.  In contrast, it went the opposite for those living in Oakwood who couldn’t identify with this theme of ownership coming from a lower socioeconomic class.  There has been an overshadowing of gang conflict as wealthier individuals emphasized Venice’s artistic and commercial side.  Even in the 1980s and 1990s, Venice was slowly renovating and improving its community.  It is, however, thanks to gang violence that the process of gentrification was stalled.  This leads into the income change of residents whose household value decreased.  In Oakwood, “the median price of houses was $161,000, over $100,000 less than 8 years earlier” (Deener, 2007).  It is important to take the perspective of real estate agents too as their jobs were made difficult due to the fears associated with Venice areas.  People living in Venice but not in Oakwood dreaded the poorer areas, which led to the beginning of white dominated communities and negligence of groups of people in other neighborhoods.  In an interview with Leslie, a white store owner, she said that she was “thankful when a newspaper article about crime in Oakwood in the 1990s did not include Abbot Kinney Boulevard as part of that neighborhood section” (Deener, 2007).  Leslie’s feeling of dissociation from Oakwood describes the feeling of resentment perfectly well as these business owners get absolutely no benefit from this area being around in Venice.   
Since the devastation from the oil overflow and the more recent acts of gang activity, there has been a notable change with the income of individuals as seen from factors such as Venice housing income during certain periods of time and the comparison of income of different races.  Although there has been an 11% increase in the household’s incomes since 2010, the growth since 2000 for 44% shows how far the Venice has come.  This leaves me wondering how so many parts of the neighborhood are still so poor despite the increase of general wealth of Venice’s citizens (“Venice Demographics”).   There is a major monetary difference in the areas of Venice Beach.  Additionally, there is also a separation of races due to income.  For household income distribution by race, income of over 200,000 dollars is dominated by Whites taking up 92% of this category while Hispanic, Black, Asian, Mixed, and Others make up the other 8%.  White people also take up the most percentage with 71% for the 150,000 to 200,000 dollars range and 88% for the 125,000 to 150,000 dollars range.  From these statistics, we can see how much wealth Whites have in household income compared to all the other races (“Venice Household Income”).  Overall, the political aspect of the oil problems in Venice society that ended up being driven by rich, white people along with the gang activity that was prominent in the 1960s, pulled away minorities from having the chance to fully establish a successful life. 

Demographics play a significant role in establishing the culture of Venice to illustrate race population and household in different parts of the community.  These statistics can show implications of the mindsets of certain races.   There is an overwhelming majority of 25.6 thousand White people living in Venice and only 6,024 Hispanics, 2,167 Blacks, and 1,615 Asians.  Not only does the White population clearly dominate the ethnicity ratio in Venice by making up 69.4% of the neighborhood, but it is almost 40% higher than the typical Los Angeles County population ethnicity range.  Venice itself is displayed as a place for many White people to thrive and make a comfortable living from just the positive response in numbers that choose to settle in the town.  Additionally, all other ethnicities are below the Los Angeles average, most notably Hispanics which dropped around 30% from the average (“Race and Ethnicity in Venice”).  The next factor in demographics I looked at were the household types that in Los Angeles and Venice specifically.  Although White households led by non married individuals by being around 10,000 while Hispanic households were 1,677 and Black households were 1,105, Hispanic households were made up by more married couples, 37%, than White married couples, 29%.  This can be explained by the age difference, religious values, career focus, or other factors of the two ethnicities.  What is known is that these differences in principles can show White individuals thrive by only supporting themselves for longer before having a spouse and children (“Venice Household Types”).  
Demographics can also be used to trace the ancestry and national origin of Venice’s population to see how migration took place and the changes that had gone on since.  Black Americans who did migrate west towards the Venice canals moved towards Oakwood neighborhood and thus created an influx of the Black population.  Housing became scarce negatively affecting the established districts (Simpson, 2012).  Although there was this rapid growth of the Black population by the time the Second Great Migration took place during the 1940s, the comparison of sizes of different ethnic groups and percentage makeup of the early settlers on the land still displays whose territory Venice belonged to by how much they dominated it.  Within the Hispanic and Asian ancestry, the two most popular groups were Mexicans and Chinese.  Today, these populations are insignificant in size as Hispanics make up 16.3% of the population in Venice while Asians are as low as 4.4% of the population; both are lower than half the average of their racial makeups in Los Angeles (“Race and Ethnicity in Venice”).  Despite Mexicans and Chinese being the most popular of the ethnic groups, they pale in comparison to the total makeup of Venice, demonstrating that not only does a specific ethnicity seem insignificant but also a whole group of people with the same cultural background that are not White.  When tracking the national origin of Venice, 42.4% came from the Americas, 34.9% from Europe, 17.7% from Oceania, and 1.5% from Africa.  With America being the much larger “continent of birth population,” Venice has been dominated by the White settlers throughout its history.  All in all, the historical origins of race symbolizes how territory, rich and poor, has been first claimed by White settlers and still belongs to them.	

Commercial infrastructure are two physical key differences when comparing the two faces of Venice. In general, Abbot Kinney Boulevard was becoming much more modernized with the growing of trendy restaurants and shopping outlets causing Venice to become one of the most expensive neighborhoods in Los Angeles.  Just from taking a trip down to Abbot Kinney, I passed by established, famous stores like Adidas and Nike and the aesthetic and trendy Blue Bottle coffee shop.  Although the reception of Abbot Kinney’s growth is appealing to tourists, many neighbors in the town feel “the supply of commercial space is ridiculously overambitious.” Customers who come in these stores are mostly tourists and Santangelo, owner of Abbot’s Habit, a coffee shop, claims all his employees used to live in Venice and now don’t (Aron 2017).  The expansion of these establishments from tourism occur so rapidly that it is definitely much harder if you are not a stable business already to become successful.  In contrast, Venice Boardwalk does not have any high end brands that are extremely well known but instead has cheaper booth style shops selling novelty items.

Because the median rental price per square foot, which Venice is tied second with Bel Air, is so high in Abbot Kinney Boulevard, the shops are expected to sell more expensive goods thus attracting wealthier customers to keep them stable.  Ira Koslow, president of Venice Neighborhood council, states that “[It has] become such a phenomenon to have Abbot Kinney on your letterhead or on your website.  The stores don’t have to make that much money. Your brand is getting that bump” (Aron 2017).  The fact that commercial establishments are associated with Abbot Kinney gives businesses a higher level of success allowing it to thrive compared to retailers that are not in this wealthy neighborhood.  Even if the businesses are run by a loss leader, when products are sold at a loss, customers will be swarming in with their hands in their wallets just knowing that these “trendy, must have it” shops will be worth the money.

In addition to the commercial structures differentiating neighborhoods in Venice, the street art in areas like Abbot Kinney and closer to the boardwalk indicate the perspectives of the people living in that area.  In the Brandelli’s Brig mural, the artist Carol Highsmith illustrates tourism, ownership, and new buildings that have developed over the years on the wealthier side of Venice.  It is notable the couple in the mural are White and are on the billboard behind them as well.  An expensive car is in the background along with an established cocktail store.  This mural symbolizes the prosperity that arises from the town and that wealthy, White people desire  There is also an extra dimension to this painting as it is a mural of a mural.  This extra layer of dimension gives the art gives more depth beyond the smiling couple as it emphasizes the focus of the owners and how they are idealized in society. 

 On the other hand, in the poorer areas like the ocean front, murals like Marioe by Marioe stands very noticeably to passerbyers strolling down the Venice Boardwalk.  This art represents the multiple minorities from Asians to Hispanics to Blacks who all are in this constant struggle to find their place in society and be well established in the rapid progression of Venice.  As these figures are floating around trying to find a solid ground to stand on, people walking by the street art are left to think how they only have each other to rely on because society has forgotten about them.  The “nude” bodies symbolize the far from successful and spiritual beauty of the ignored minorities trying to surface themselves to the top of society but never being able to.  This relates to the poorer side of Venice compared to Abbot Kinney Boulevard and how extreme two places of the same town can be when dominated by different ethnicities.

Interviews with entrepreneurs, minorities, and locals from wealthier neighborhoods depict the emotional response to the development of Venice that isn’t depicted in the demographic statistics.  Reporters sense the feeling that Abbot Kinney Boulevard residents dominate the area and “control the identity of the street” as opposed to feeling a vibe of invasion of territory.  This causes social and economic exclusivity due to unofficial ownership and consent of specific areas.  Another White storeowner named Amy, stated that it is required that you have some money to shop at her establishment and the clientele is more popular with San Diego to Redondo residents with money (Deener, 2007).  Shop owners are not even thinking about the locals as their main source of income because locals do not necessarily find these products appealing or have the money to purchase from these stores.  Natasha, a 43 year old African American woman, sees beauty and wealth in a whole other light: “I don’t think a one-thousand-dollar dress on Abbot Kinney is what’s beautiful. I just don’t.  I liked how it was before when it really was bohemian” (Deener, 2007).  Interestingly, Natasha displays some sense of nostalgia to the street and appreciates the simpler more artistic element as opposed to just how well stores have developed economically.  The same goes for African American woman Mildred who feels Abbot Kinney Boulevard is for tourists similar to communities like Beverly Hills and Melrose.  One of the most compelling cases of White superiority criticizing the progress of other minorities came up during Dante’s interview.  He is an African American man who owns a pizza shop on Abbot Kinney but still receives criticism for employing kids from his neighborhood and black friends.  To have someone like Dante who is facing opposition for trying to create more opportunities for minorities shows the thought process of some wealthy White business people which brings morality to the development of Venice. 

Venice has ultimately shown that the development of the beach community has been dominated by a wealthy, White population since the beginning of the oil crises and gang activities.  This has lead them to thrive over minority populations over the past several decades as seen by income changes, commercial infrastructure, and racial demographics.  The political and racial components of dividing Venice into two communities, wealthy and poor, are accompanied by the environmental factor of street art which symbolizes the lives of those living by the boardwalk and the modernized, high end Abbot Kinney Boulevard.  Interviews with locals living on both of these sides also illustrate the emotional aspect by looking through the mindset of its citizens.  The development of this “Slum by the Sea” goes hand in hand with White superiority and the disregarding of minorities on what appears to be a relaxing beach front.
