Sunday morning mass at St. John’s Episcopal Church on Figueroa and West 27th Street is flooded with University Park locals. Meanwhile, neighboring apartments are full of University of Southern California students—myself included—hiding under pillows, attempting to silence the blaring church bells, and praying for another hour of sleep and recovery. I avoid interactions with the locals of University Park—biking quickly, headphones in, music blasting. My friends and I alienate ourselves from the broader community, secluded behind the secured boundaries of USC where we discuss current events, tedious essays, and upcoming parties. The University Park neighborhood and the University of Southern California build their respective communities through food and religion. Food is central to community development but expensive dining options at USC polarize it from the less wealthy options in University Park. Religious institutions in University Park bring locals together with food and rituals; at USC, religion is not as successful at creating strong relationships among students. Although USC is at the heart of University Park, the two areas are in stark contrast in terms of demographics. Many students at USC come from wealthy backgrounds while most locals of University Park have low incomes. This reveals implications regarding access to healthy food options and ties to religion—lower rates of wealth and education lead to higher involvement in faith practices. Differences in wealth limit the extent to which the two communities are able to merge and develop long term relationships with one another. 
	 
   The broader University Park(UPark) and smaller University of Southern California(USC) communities vary in racial demographics and diversity. As a private university, USC has autonomy over the types of students it admits while UPark is a public part of Los Angeles. According to the Los Angeles Times, University Park’s demographics consist of 16.1% Asians, 7% black, and 25.5% white (Los Angeles, 2018). This variation in races shows high racial diversity in the community. Meanwhile, USC’s population is 16.8% Asians, 5.6% black, and 30.7% white (USC, 2018). USC is slightly less racially diverse than UPark. While the number of Asians is equivalent, there are fewer black people and higher rates of white people at USC. These racial demographics also tie into income levels.
	
   The household incomes of students at USC are much higher than those of locals living in UPark. USC, notoriously known as a college made for “spoiled children,” has millions of dollars in endowment and students have access to some of the best facilities in the world. Conversely, the average household income in UPark is $32,164 (Point2Homes, 2018). This number is alarming because it indicates that many households in UPark fall below the federal poverty line household income of $28,000 (PeopleKeep, 2017). This is in stark contrast to the family income of students at USC. “The median family income of a student from USC is $161,400” (New York Times, 2015). These numbers indicate wide disparities in wealth between two communities that interact with each other through shared land, facilities, and businesses. 
	
   Mercado La Paloma, a marketplace on Figueroa St. that hosts local food and crafts vendors, focuses on building economic confidence in the UPark area. Historically, UPark’s small businesses have received little investment and funding—making it difficult to withstand competition from larger corporations and institutions that threaten them. USC, for example, has encouraged national restaurant chains, serving students, to open on Figueroa St.; this has pushed out small businesses that cater to UPark locals who also want access to culturally diverse foods. “By providing affordable retail opportunities, technical assistance, start-up capital and support, Mercado La Paloma seeks to create business ownership opportunities and living wage jobs in our community” (Mercado La Paloma, 2016). The community currently lacks investment and is desperately in need of resources and economic growth. Mercado La Paloma serves as way of bringing more jobs for locals and supporting local businesses. With banks such as Wells Fargo and Merrill Lynch sponsoring the market, there is promise that economic confidence will develop over time. This will also ensure that small businesses are not threatened, maintaining a sense of community among locals through food.

   Food facilitates and is central to community development. By offering a place for locals to eat, sell, and discuss their cultures, Mercado La Paloma fosters communal experiences. The art in the image below is a visual representation of the diversity within UPark. Mercado La Paloma encourages locals of UPark to spend time together while enjoying food from different cultures. The image shows people of different ethnicities selling and buying goods at the market as well as families sitting at the tables eating food, revealing that the community does place an emphasis on communal experiences.

By having an immersive experience surrounded by food and cultural art, locals can learn about new traditions as well as maintain existing ones. “Food-centered activities can be shown to foster community building in schools among teachers, school families and the surrounding neighborhood” (Richardson, 2010). Food brings people together such as during lunch time in schools and dinners with family. “Children’s use of food and collaborative production of food exchange during lunchtime plays a crucial role in children’s formation of ethnic boundaries and identity” (Richardson, 2010). This research study demonstrates how sharing food at lunchtime builds community and cultural understanding. Mercado La Paloma offers a variety of cuisines and cultural artifacts that help shape an understanding of the many cultures present in the UPark neighborhood. By having a place for all ages to enjoy, Mercado La Paloma drives communal and cultural experiences in UPark.

   Food develops community among the locals of UPark but the area is, for the most part, classified as a food desert where healthy meals are limited. USC students tend to have varied options and the ability to eat healthy food at dining halls and eateries on campus whereas locals who work long, tedious hours do not have the time or knowledge on how to cook or plan healthy meals. As a result, locals turn to the inexpensive and unhealthy fast food options surrounding the USC campus—McDonald’s, Jack In the Box, and Carl’s Junior. Aside from national restaurant chains, there are a plethora of taco stands such as the one shown in the image below. This specific taco stand in the image is popular among locals and USC students alike. Its open layout brings people together by providing a shared experience—one that encourages sitting and standing with strangers while enjoying food. This contrasts dining options at USC, which aim to build a wall between students and locals.

   USC’s dining options bring the USC community together but tend to exclude outsiders. On campus there are three dining halls, numerous restaurants at the Tutor Campus Center and USC Village, food trucks, and a weekly farmer’s market. Many organizations at USC also offer food—club meetings, student government events, and meal plans at sororities and fraternities. Each of these facilitate community development among students. However, they simultaneously restrict locals from interacting with USC students. Dining halls are mostly used by students with meal plans. It is not advertised that anybody, not only students, can enter dining halls by paying per meal. The farmer’s market is meant to be open to all but the products sold—nut butters and expensive jewelry—discourage locals from purchasing items and enjoying the healthy options available at the market. USC’s pricey options drive locals away, both directly and indirectly. Despite this discrepancy, there are other ways the two communities build connections—through religion. 
	
   Religion and food are intertwined with community development; religion uses food for ritual and symbolism, both of which carry significance for devotees. Many faith traditions base creation stories and rituals around food. “Whether it is Brahman cooking the world into existence or Adam and Eve being driven away from paradise because of an apple, food has allowed religious peoples to relate to their gods, each other, and the world” (Norman, 2012). Many religions use food as a way to encourage communal experiences and to explain global phenomena. Food connects people in a unique way—by enjoying the same food, such as through Communion, people have a shared memory that builds relationships. This can also be seen through lunches after church on Sundays or Shabbat dinners on Friday nights. Meals with family and friends give people the opportunity to socialize and create lasting memories. Despite the social benefits of attending religious rituals, such as a network of like-minded people, many people in today’s society have moved away from religion. 

   Religion is negatively correlated to wealth and education. As wealth and education both reach higher levels, religion seems to be given less importance. A graph from the Pew Research Center reveals that less wealthier nations tend to be more religious. (Pew Research Center 2015) There is an inverse relationship between wealth and religion. Similarly, “the negative effect of education on religious belief causes more educated individuals to sort into less fervent religions, which explains the negative relationship between education and religion across denominations” (Glaeser, 2001). This paradox equates with a secular lifestyle where religion is absent as people acquire more money and education. These findings can be applied to make conclusions about UPark and USC. 

   Locals of UPark are highly involved with the varied religious institutions in the area. A majority of UPark’s locals maintain low socioeconomic statuses—entailing lower levels of education and wealth. UPark also has many religious centers that are frequented by locals—churches for various Christian denominations, masjids for Muslims, and a Buddhist temple.

   Looking at the numbers, UPark and surrounding areas have seventeen places of worship while USC has only four. Using this data it is clear that the saturation of attendees is much higher for UPark than it is at USC. Based on the demographics mentioned earlier, UPark has both low levels of income combined with high participation in places of worship. While locals seem to create relationships with one another through faith and rituals, the same cannot be said for many of the students at USC. 
	
   Religion is not a viable method for building community at USC. The school has over eighty religious organizations such as the Caruso Catholic center, Hindu Student Organization(HSO), Hillel, and the University Religious Center. The wide variety of religious institutions gives students the opportunity to explore numerous faith traditions or find comfort in ones they were raised in. Despite the plethora of options to choose from, many students are not involved with the religious organizations USC has to offer. Amulya Donthi, a current sophomore at USC attended one of the HSO’s rituals: “I was expecting many people to be there but it was only me, a priest, and 2 other people.” Only a small fraction of students at USC are involved with religious events—it does not seem to be a significant source of community development. This correlates with data on religious affiliations among college students across the nation. An article from the Scientific American states that “the number of college students with no religious affiliation has tripled in the last 30 years, from 10 percent in 1986 to 31 percent in 2016” (Downey, 2017). Most college students tend to stray away from religion, corroborating Amulya’s comment above. Although students are leaving religion behind, organizations on campus have and are still making efforts to reach out and encourage participation. Hillel has Friday evening Shabbat dinner, HSO promotes rituals through Facebook events, and the Vice President of Religious Affairs, Varun Soni, reaches out to students through emails. Despite the lack of involvement, religion is not the only source of community building. USC’s tight knit “Trojan spirit” stems from a loyal football following and distinct alumni network. This unique culture ensures a community within USC but also excludes outsiders. 
	
   Both UPark and USC have strong communities that are founded upon years of tradition and maintained through food and religion. Dining halls are where acquaintances cross paths and new friendships begin; at Mercado La Paloma locals interact for the first or hundredth time. While there are student run organizations at USC that aim to help locals of UPark, the two communities are not deeply interconnected. A polarizing culture and demographics are to blame for this wall between two communities that should seemingly be one. The clear divide between affluent students and the low income earning and less educated local community reflects broader segregations within this nation and the world. It is up to both the locals of UPark and students at USC to bridge the gap and merge. I am guilty of playing a part in this discriminatory culture; my fears stem from prejudices that tell me to protect myself from strangers who could find ways to take advantage of me. In my recent interactions with locals, I have found that our communities have similarities—emphasizing morality, considering social issues, and most importantly, eating good food with the people we care about. By sharing experiences and extending a hand of compassion, both parties can benefit, shaping a better future for all.
