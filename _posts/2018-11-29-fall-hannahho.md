   You’re standing on the corner of Main Street, waiting for the light to change. You look to your right. You see people weaving through warehouses full of zippers and fabrics looking for tools for their next project. You look to the left. There are people in suits on their phones walking in and out of bank skyscrapers and bars. Just a few blocks away from the Fashion District and Jewelry District is the monster that’s eating them alive–the Financial District. Downtown Los Angeles (DTLA), a massive neighborhood in Los Angeles (LA) divided into its own sub-regions, is shifting from an artistic community to a banking-culture dominated community. With more bankers, DTLA’s demographic is changing, stores come into DTLA to cater the banker lifestyle, and DTLA becomes an exclusive district. DTLA is becoming less affordable with infrastructural redevelopments and with the expansion of bars and construction. It is also becoming an exclusive elitist community, evidently through the inaccessibility of murals. 

   Comparing the census data of LA as a whole to DTLA reveals the downtown lifestyle. QuickFacts’ 2017 Census says LA has a population about four million people with about 8000 people per square mile and the Census Reporter says DTLA (East Central/Central City) has a population of about 187,000 people with about 12,200 people per square mile. This means DTLA is about 4.7% of LA’s total population and that it is a more densely populated area of LA, as the average population per square mile for LA is a lot smaller. There are also about 500,000 firms in Los Angeles. With the bustling number of firms in a smaller square footage, DTLA was bound to be more densely populated than the rest of LA. 67% of those in LA are between the ages 18 and 64 (QuickFacts), indicating that the majority of LA is comprised of working individuals or students. This makes sense with the location’s proximity to the University of Southern California and the Fashion Institute of Design as well as the banking culture. The LA Almanac separates DTLA into 12 parts: the Arts District, Bunker Hill, City West, Civic Center, Fashion/Warehouse Districts, Financial District, Historic Core, Little Tokyo, Northeast, South Park, Southeast and the Toy District. It reveals that the total population of the Financial District is significantly less than that of other sub-divisions and that it has demographics with 50% Asian, 28% being white, 11% Hispanic or Latino, 8% Black populations (LA Almanac). There is also a predominant minority presence in LA with 48% Hispanic, 12% Asian, 9% Black–leaving only 29% White (QuickFacts). This reveals that the Financial District of DTLA is not a good representation of the entirety of Los Angeles–both population wise and demographic wise. The Financial District is dominated by the Asians and Caucasians in the banking workforce, rather than Hispanics. The people on the streets, in the businesses and in the banks reveal more than just the racial demographics of those who work in the Financial District.

 The pedestrians’ clothes and actions, if looked at closely, reveal whether they work or live in DTLA. The people are generally dressed well, mostly wearing business casual attire, are most likely a part of the white collar working members (bankers) of the Financial District (Figure 1a). These individuals are focused on getting somewhere, usually wearing headphones, indicating that they do not want to be bothered; talking to other people; or discussing business matters on the phone. There are less artists and casually dressed people on the streets. There are only busy business people who have somewhere to be and something to do. There is a surprisingly large representation of women–insinuating that there are more females entering the banking world (Figure 1a). With the rise of the feminist movement as well as a recently passed bill in California that requires corporate boards of directors to include women, this makes sense. 25% of California’s publicly traded companies do not have a woman on their board, so Governor Brown believed it was time for California to bring gender diversity to the corporate oars (McGreevy). Though the Financial District is not known for being a residential area, there were a couple of individuals walking their dogs and wearing casual attire (Figure 1b)–distinguishing them from the workers. These were a rare sight, as the Financial District is not known for being a residential area. Even those who are a part of the banking circle do not want to live in the center of it all, despite the Financial District being built entirely for them. 
   Due to the gentrification of DTLA, the economic demographic is changing and rent is becoming unstable, deterring many from living in DTLA even if they work there. Something as simple as a difference in trash cans can shine light on the gentrification of an area of a city. The $30 trash can in Skid Row compared to the $200-500 open-lid metal trash cans and the $4000-5000 solar-power operated trash compactors in Pershing Square suggestively reflect the economic gap of the subdivisions within DTLA (Lee 16-17). With more and more solar-power operated trash bins on the streets, it is evident that those who cannot afford the lifestyle are being pushed out. This reveals not only the wealth disparity in DTLA, but also the uneven and inconsistent land-values, especially in land near subway stations. This is potentially due to major transit stops being within redevelopment districts such as DTLA (Cervero 2002). With the construction of newer modern buildings for firms and the unstable rent rates driving the lower class out, DTLA is becoming a place only suitable for the white collar businesspersons.
   The stores and companies present in DTLA are suited to cater to those who live the banker lifestyle of the Financial District. With the increasing presence of the banking lifestyle, DTLA is also undergoing construction to create more space for more firms and bars to satisfy the needs and desires of businesspersons. Various cultures feature the social practice of sharing drinks. This is called bar culture and it happens to be a huge part of the business world. Businesspersons make deals and develop business relationships and co-workers simply grab a drink after work to socialize. Walking even five blocks, one can spot two or three bars on every block, with Bunker Hill Bar & Grill, Casey’s, and Karl Strauss being a few (Figures 2a-c).

 Within the bars, even at 5 pm, there are people in business casual clothes sharing a drink (Figure 2a)–perhaps just networking–and there are people in business formal clothes on computers with paperwork laid out on the table (Figure 2c)–perhaps an indication of a business deal being made. In a 2015 L.A. Times article, Josh Stephens writes, “Many Los Angeles residents have no place within walking distance to share a pitcher of beer or a bottle of wine with friends. As a result, they can't just ‘get a drink.’ They have to ‘go out,’ which often means driving to an area where large numbers of true bars are tolerated, like Downtown.” The Financial District in particular is known for its bar culture, so not only are bars full of businesspersons, but also residents from all over LA looking to have a drink. The businesses and people who make up a neighborhood shape that neighborhood’s culture and determine what other businesses and individuals can flourish in it. Because of this inevitable phenomena, while there are plenty of infrastructural renewal projects and the flourishing of bars, other social issues that desperately need the city’s budget are forgotten. “There was no mechanism to redistribute any share of additional city revenues to purposes other than infrastructure or Downtown renewal. There was no ‘linkage’ between corporate-oriented public investment and the social needs that desperately fought for attention in the rest of the city budget. Moreover, the dynamic leadership concentrated on improving Downtown seemed directly subtracted from attention paid to the city’s neighborhoods and their subsistence needs” (Davis vii-viii). Social issues such as rent control, homelessness, and the protection of small businesses are all disregarded–the city simply focuses on molding itself to cater to the wealthy bankers.

   The city councilmen are almost pressured to modify the city to make more room to accommodate this banking and bar culture. At the same time, they are trying to benefit off the spread of bars. “In late March, council member Mike Bonin introduced a motion that, if passed, would, according to the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, add $2,484 to the already astronomical cost of opening a bar or liquor-serving restaurant in Los Angeles” (Stephens). An extra $2000 is nothing for these big businesses, but it drives out the small businesses–creating a path for more big businesses (bars) to come into DTLA. Taking care of the small business owners is not a concern the councilmen as they only care about increasing the city’s budget. Constructing these new bars creates a hostile environment for homeless people, as they cannot just linger on aside construction areas, as well as pedestrians, who do not have a clean sidewalk to walk on. This hostility creates an exclusive community for bankers who can afford cars and pushes everybody else who cannot afford this lifestyle out of DTLA. 
   This nature of exclusivity extends to realms of art. The so-called public murals of DTLA are inaccessible: two murals placed in subway stops are difficult to find due to their inconvenient locations or surrounding construction (despite being open to the public) and two other murals cease to exist and nobody knows about them–perhaps due to the lack of maintenance of public murals in LA. “Subway terminal building, Los Angeles, ca. 1926” by Ravenna Mosaic Company is difficult to find–one has to walk around the entire block to find it (Figure 3a). There is also construction next to it, which was deterring (Figure 3a). Meanwhile, “City above, Los Angeles, 1990” Terry Schoonhoven is inconveniently placed on the ceiling above the escalators (Figure 4a-d). Though metro-users may see the signs on the ceiling going down, no one really makes the effort to look 90 degrees up while they go up the escalator. Because of this inconvenience, the intended audience is prevented from seeing the mural and it becomes exclusive to those who actively seek out the mural. The artists’ message and emotions are suppressed and the mural is treated as something that simply fills empty space.

Other times, art is tossed to the side perhaps due to the lack of space in DTLA or because it is considered unimportant and not worth maintaining by the city. Two murals, “Treaty of Cahuenga, Los Angeles, 1931” by Hugo Ballin and “Stamps of victory, Los Angeles, 1994” by Johanna Poethig, in the Financial District simply cannot be found. Many people do not even know about them and if one actively tries to look for it, it cannot be found. These murals are literally and figuratively off the map. This reveals how the city views these murals and again makes the mural exclusive to those who actively seek out public art.
   Other murals in DTLA are inaccessible due to its exclusivity: the murals are only available within buildings where credentials are required. “California moments, Los Angeles, 1991” by Richard Wyatt was only available to those who were a part of The Gas Company. One cannot access the elevators up to see mural (Figure 5b) past the escalators (Figure 5a). The mural is advertised as being in the public cafeteria, however the security guard (Figure 5c) dictated that only members of The Gas Company were allowed access past that point. This is reflecting privilege, as only a highly selective audience (the members of the company) can see the mural that is advertised as public and meant for all of LA to see and relate to.

Another mural, “The Apotheosis of power, Los Angeles, 1930” (Figure 6c) by Hugo Ballin was also unavailable to the public. The Torrey Pines Bank doors are locked so only employees could enter–making it an exclusively viewed mural (Figure 6a). One could walk in as a banker is walking out, but there is awkward tension with the receptionist and feelings of not belonging (Figure 6b). This indicates that the audience for this mural is just the wealthy bankers; it is only intended for the elite to walk by it and admire it as they walk into work. This is reflecting privilege, as only a highly selective audience can see this mural. At one point in history, art was a luxury as only the wealthy had the leisure time to admire it. “At a time when the middle class was striving to incorporate into its own vocabulary the type of painting formerly appropriated by the wealthy, the wealthy were beginning to distinguish themselves by buying abstract expressionist art, hesitantly at first (1943-45) but alter with ever increasing confidence” (Guilbaut 95). As soon as art becomes something the middle class can also afford, the wealthy do something to distinguish themselves. This is being done in contemporary DTLA as “public” murals are made unavailable and exclusive to the privileged. As the Financial District takes over the art districts of DTLA and makes public murals inaccessible, it is creating an exclusive, elitist community for the bankers. The inaccessibility and privilege associated with the art bring upon the impression that everything about the Downtown Financial District is built around the business culture to cater the white collar employees of these firms. As much as they say the murals are for the public and everyone of Los Angeles, their locations suggest otherwise.

   DTLA is already different from Los Angeles as a whole in terms of ethnic and gender demographics and population density. With the expansion of the Financial District, the ethnic and economic demographics are reshaping and rent is becoming unstable, deterring many from living in DTLA even if they work there. At the same time, the businesses and stores you see on the streets are evolving to cater to the well-dressed bankers and businesspeople that swamp the Financial District. Ultimately, DTLA is dominated by construction sites that are creating space for more firms and bars–becoming an exclusive community. It is making public murals inaccessible, making DTLA unaffordable to live in, and creating a hostile environment for the homeless. The exclusive nature of the murals alludes to how DTLA is shifting towards becoming a wealthier community defined by the banking industry–only allowing the privileged to see the “public” art–which goes hand in hand with the Financial District slowly pushing out the art communities of DTLA. The Financial District of DTLA has a changing demographic, caters to the spreading business culture, and creates an exclusive community for bankers. DTLA has become a slave to the business firms and banks, and in a matter of time it may spread to all of Los Angeles. One day, you’ll be on Main Street, look left and right, and only see bank skyscrapers and bars.
