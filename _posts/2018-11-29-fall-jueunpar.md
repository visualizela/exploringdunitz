Walking along the beach side and watching the sun sink down the coast, you can feel the youthful atmosphere of the Venice area. This little town in Los Angeles is where you can be engaged with different forms of arts by watching street art performances and looking at colorful murals on the walls. Not only does Venice invite you to be a part of the living arts, but it also provides luxurious dining experience and leisure activities found along the shopping avenue. The community around the Venice Beach Boardwalk has benefited from changing demographics and increasing land value over the process of gentrification with preservation of its authentic artistic history; however, the art and murals found at the Boardwalk paradoxically depict the community’s core challenge of racial and social segregation hidden under the name of gentrification. Since the 1900s, Venice has attracted a large crowd of white, middle-class residents due to development of car ownership and of coastal leisure activities, leading to a dramatic increase in recent land values with the arrivals of tech companies. While growing both socially and economically, Venice also aims to preserve its authentic history of art by conserving murals and promoting artistic events in the community. However, this process of gentrification in reality is exclusive in a way that the longest-living residents in the area are geographically segregated from commercial activities and even criminalized. 

Venice has experienced gradual demographic and economic transformations over the last century through both internal and external forces, such as new coastal residential developments and the rise of automobile ownership. In the late 1800s, beaches in Southern California including Venice Beach were described as “largely empty and foreboding shores merged with ocean” that were separated from the downtown Los Angeles with nearly a day-long drive, making the area one of the most remote places in Los Angeles. Due to these factors, the only visitors to the coast were a small group of social elites coming to enjoy a coastal leisure during holiday seasons (Jacoby 2). One major internal factor that transformed a large crowd of affluent white tourists to residents was the year-round versatility of Southern Californian beaches, which led people to buy more personal lands for residential and commercial purposes (5). The new group of residents put conscious effort into developing coastal leisure to lure more visitors. In addition to their attempt to improve the financial value of the area, development of transportation allowed the Coastal areas to be easily accessible and enjoyable to a wider range of demographics. Ownership of automobiles of Los Angeles residents increased dramatically from less than 20,000 in 1910 to over 100,000 in 1920 (69). This dramatic increase in automobile ownership per household meant that a journey to Venice, which once required advanced planning and long train rides, became an easy trip. This change convinced more people to choose Venice as the final destination for their residence with the appealing weather condition and convenient transportation. The increased number of residents in the coastal area and number of private vehicles of the city marked the beginning of Venice’s gentrification.
Indents do not, so just put a space in for each new paragraph.

Following the changes in demographics of Venice in the 1900s, the comparison of consensus demographic and economic data of Venice today with that of Los Angeles reveals Venice’s status at its peak stage of gentrification. Venice has an approximate total population of 51,330 today: 66.3% of the total population has a Bachelor’s Degree or higher and 69.4% are Caucasian (“Venice CA Demographics”). These two data sets of Venice are high for Los Angeles when compared to the average Bachelor’s degree-obtained and Caucasian population of the city, which are 33% and 49%, respectively (“Venice CA Demographics”). The education level of Venice perhaps represents the increased number of middle-class or upper-class households in the area who can afford higher education. Similarly, the ethnicity ratio reinforces the earlier point that wealthy Caucasians were the first group to settle down in the area for leisure purposes and develop the land for personal profits. Furthermore, the comparison of mean and median income of the neighborhood residents to that of Los Angeles reflects how economically developed the town is compared to other areas in the same city. The mean and median household income of Venice are $121,265 and $84,386, meaning that the population is skewed towards upper-class residents whose income is higher than the median (“Venice”). Furthermore, the consumption pattern shown in Figure 1 also shows that the total household expenditure of Venice is above the national average, illustrating the high economic status of its incoming and existing residents. The increasing economic status and changing demographics of Venice continue to grow at a faster rate today with recent establishments of commercial opportunities in the neighborhood.

An influx of tech startup corporations followed by the creation of an art district in the area demonstrates its changing community identity. In 1905, Abbot Kinney created his fantasy city of “Venice of America” by building the canals. This little town became known as “a mini Hollywood invasion” in the late 1990s with many artists and former hippies staying in the area after their success (Olen 160). Developing since then, Abbot Kinney Boulevard became a luxurious avenue of popular shops, boutique restaurants and galleries that attract a number of international tourists and youthful populations from the city who are willing to enjoy luxurious shopping along the beautiful beach walk. The effect of this art district on the community’s financial prospects was synergized with the recent arrivals of tech companies, including Google, YouTube and Snapchat. These companies and startups brought hundreds of employees to the area, which increased the demand for housing in the area and the percentage of affluent group of residents in the community, leading to an escalating land value. Between the year of 2016 and 2017, the average sale prices of the beach community jumped about 20% to nearly $2.439 million (Chiland). The change in the real estate value of Venice reflects how the area is in the process of gentrification that is caused by a greater number of visitors and higher demand for housing. While the fast-paced growth of commercial activities in Venice acts as an essential role in reshaping the community’s identity, residents of Venice are trying to preserve their rich history of arts to continue its identity as an authentic community.

The existing and incoming residents of Venice aim to develop commercial value of the land while preserving the artistic culture of the town by anti-corporate branding and promoting arts around the neighborhood. Abbot Kinney Boulevard contains independently owned stores and restricts the invasion of formula retail chains, or large corporates, in order to promote the neighborhood’s value as a “bohemian community” (Deener). When tourists visit Venice for a shopping avenue, they can interact with local residents and shop owners along the window-shops and learn about everyday community life of Venice, where they can experience the blend of art and commerce. Venice Newspaper once titled the street’s success as “Brand Venice” and defined the town as innovative and independent neighborhood (Rothman). The local residents, merchants, and real estate capitalists play a significant role in reshaping or redefining the community’s identity as they collectively strive to sustain the history around Abbot Kinney Boulevard. Additionally, the murals found around the neighborhood are an epitome of their conscious effort to establish an authentic community with preservation of its artistic culture through the use of the area itself. For example, the mural titled “Community Tree” reflects the community’s vision of creating an inclusive, supportive society for all local residents. With its utilization of vibrant colors and portrayal of numerous names on branches of the tree, the mural incorporates art to express the neighborhood’s authentic identity. Although the names on the mural are not specifically identified, these may be the names of the artists or local residents who are part of the community. Due to the ongoing economic development and preservation of artistic culture of Venice, the neighborhood is known as the ground of racial, economic, and cultural diversity of existing and incoming residents. 

Venice is home of different racial and economic groups, and this diversity with the process of gentrification provides those at lower ends the opportunities to improve their quality of life. According to a landmark study about social mobility and geography conducted by Harvard, UC-Berkeley and the U.S. Treasury in 2014, cities with more upward mobility -the ability of individuals to have better quality of life than parents- tend to have higher quality education, stable families, and economic diversity (Chetty et al. 42). In other words, lower-income individuals can have a higher chance of achieving social mobility in the cities where poor, wealthy, and middle-class households live together. The study also states that the places with racial and economic segregation where the poor minorities are geographically separated from the wealthier populations have lower rates of social mobility. Venice consists of a mixture of economically and racially diverse groups of residents who moved in at different time periods. The white social elites have arrived since the early 1900s; middle-class men started moving in the late 1900s; and the lower-income residents have come to this city for better standards of living from different areas in the city. In an interview with a lower-income resident living in Venice, believes that living with richer group of people make her kids feel more confident and motivated to try harder to acquire something that others around them have (McEvers). Thus, many economists and researchers believe that this economic diversity preserved in the authentic community enables lower-income residents to be part of the process of the neighborhood’s gentrification and its positive outcomes. 

While Venice may seem like a neighborhood of diverse racial and economic populations, the segregation of the longest-living residents from the rest of the new residents has failed to be eradicated, leaving the third and fourth generations of low-income residents to be hindered from pursuing the developing commercial activities in Venice. As shown in Figure 3 Abbot Kinney Boulevard now acts as a border that divides the area into two different communities: the avenue is at “the edge” of Oakwood residential area where a low-income Black and Latino group has lived. Unlike other parts of Venice, which middle- and upper-class households have moved in since the 1980s, Oakwood is home for an aging African American community and for other group of low-income Latino residents who are federally subsidized (Deener). Venice and its themed environment around Abbot Kinney Boulevard make it challenging for Oakwood residents to join the new central neighborhood because they are trapped in the society where only the poor households are around. Therefore, this area in Venice does not apply to the economic studies discussed in the previous paragraph; residents in Oakwood has a lower chance of moving upwards in the society since their area is not economically diverse. The residents on the other side of the street put conscious effort to produce the authentic atmosphere by promoting privately-owned shops, anticorporate branding and living under the theme; however, they do not “make equal efforts to protect the use of the street for long-time residents who cannot afford to shop at the new upscale commerce” (Deener). This makes the process of gentrification of Venice exclusive to those living in the themed environments not to those who have been in the area for the longest time. The racial and economic segregation is further highlighted by some cases that clearly show discrimination against the lower-economic status residents, including the homeless.

In addition to the geographical segregation against the Oakwood residents, the minorities face the challenge of lack of affordable houses that economically bar them from joining the so-called “authentic community” and exclusion of the homeless through hostile architecture and even criminalization of the homeless. With gentrification of the city, there has been an increase in the value in real estate and thus housing for the local residents. Although some federal subsidies may enable lower-income households to afford smaller one or two-unit houses, the group of the poorest or the homeless cannot afford the rocketing housing prices. With a large crowd of new incoming residents whose income ranges from middle- to upper-class, the long-living local residents from the area are under the housing-price pressures (Abcarian). They are constantly pushed out of the housing areas, leading to an increase in the number of homeless at encampments.

Figure 4 depicts the homeless belonging found at the Venice beach. While gentrification of the neighborhood allowed a large percentage of populations to enjoy more luxurious and convenient lifestyle, the lives of the homeless have not changed, if not became worse. When I visited Venice and walked around the neighborhood, I could witness the stark difference between different economic groups. Although the new residents and merchants in Venice say they are preserving the history of the town instead of neglecting them to proceed into the glowing process of gentrification, the real history of ethnic diversity of Venice has been overlooked. Furthermore, the hostile architecture found on every block of the street, as shown in Figure 5, contradicts the community identity as preservation of local residents reshaped by the incoming residents. This social issue can be further highlighted by criminalization of homeless and a police shooting incidence against an unarmed homeless man in 2015 (Lewis). With little justification, this incidence brought the public’s attention to not only police brutality and criminalization of the homeless but also displacement of people through gentrification who are often targeted by the police activities. 

Venice, a luxuriously themed town where artists, merchants and tourists interact at the local level, has experienced dramatic changes in demographics, economic value of the land and structure of commercial activities in the town through the process of gentrification. The incoming residents and merchants of Venice claim that they are preserving the history and authenticity of the community by promoting their local brands as well as supporting a variety of artistic activities around Abbot Kinney Boulevard. Nevertheless, it is crucial to recognize how the community has completely neglected the minorities living in Oakwood or those displaced by upscale housing prices that resulted from the exclusive gentrification and ironical “preservation” of authentic community. The beautiful sunset and energetic atmosphere the artists present to visitors at the Venice beach shows only one side of the neighborhood. The other side is unveiled under the glowing surface of Venice, which the public chooses to omit from the Venice Boulevard scene. If the longest-living residents are not part of the process of gentrification and even discriminated against, the process cannot be truly adding value to the development of the neighborhood. Instead of precluding this minority group from the advantages of gentrification by neglecting their stories and building hostile architecture, the incoming residents and merchants, who play significant roles in reshaping the community’s identity, need to provide services and voice to help include the third and fourth generations of lower income residents and homeless to be part of the community and enjoy the beauty of the sunset and arts of Venice Beach.
