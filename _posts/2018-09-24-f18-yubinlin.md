  In the midnight of March 13th, 1967, Kitty Genovese walked to her apartment in New York City after work. A man stabbed her back with a knife as she painfully screamed: “Oh my God, He stabbed me, Help me!” Kitty struggled to go home after the attacker ran away. Shortly the attacker returned to the apartment hallway, stabbing barely conscious Kitty to death. None of the 30 witnesses offered her help before the killer returns. This murder sparked the discussion about the apathy in big cities. As a megalopolis, Los Angeles naturally falls into this debate. The heart of Los Angeles belongs to its downtown area, suitable for the exploration of artistic and interpersonal ambiance. Downtown Los Angeles flourishes from diverse culture amplifier from demographic and murals but lacks friendliness among its residents. The history of its residents, as well as its unique urban structures, enrich downtown Los Angeles culturally while constituting income differences. Hostile architecture resulted from gentrification spawns guarded atmospheres, worsening the living pressure in downtown Los Angeles. Murals in this area, though lacking accessibility, exhibit unique civilization from its residents, but protesters often vandalize these murals under suspicion of proclaiming stereotype.
  
  As the center of a metropolis, downtown Los Angeles is nourished by a rich ethnic history that established strong industrial foundations. First established in 1781 by Felipe de Neve from Spain, Los Angeles was first occupied by forty-four original settlers know as Los Angeles Pobladores. This colony was soon merged into New Spain’s territory and then transferred to Mexico. After more than two centuries, Los Angeles still preserves some characteristics from its earliest residents as well as these, which is reflected on the demographic data and census. According to the 2010 US census data, around 50% of the population in Downtown Los Angeles is Hispanic or Latino (“US Census Bureau QuickFacts: Los”). By comparison, the national average of the Latino population is around 16% (Ennis). This relatively large group of Hispanic residents in this area constructed the rich Mexican culture in downtown Los Angeles. In addition, Los Angeles secured the first stop for immigrants to pursue their American dream from cross the Pacific Ocean. The first wave of Chinese immigrants began in the mid-1850s – as servants. Chinatown formed as these immigrants accumulated over times, adding traditional Chinese cultures such as acupuncture, herb medicine, and Feng Shui. The similar story was repeated on Japanese and Korean immigrants, cultivating Korean Town and Little Tokyo. The culture mixing in Los Angeles did not stop at Asian immigrants. During World War II, as defense production went on overdrive, labor force, consisting mainly African Americans, moved across America to Los Angeles, devoting themselves into the production of steel, rubber, and automobiles. African Americans thrived in Compton – the origin of new populated Hip-Hop and Rap music (Simpson). Los Angeles melts the tradition and culture from different ethnicity and forges these into different aspects of the city. These characteristics on lifestyle stand out when compared with average U.S. counties.
  
  The underlying motive behind immigration attributes to the rapid growth of economy in Los Angeles. During the early twentieth century, Los Angeles experienced a period a rapid development due to its production of petroleum. Versatile forms of transportation, including Santa Fe railway, Southern Pacific, and ports in Santa Monica, channeled the exportation of such product. During the World War I and II, the industrial production level skyrocketed due to Los Angeles’ proximity to Pacific War. Today, downtown Los Angeles still belongs to one of the most productive area in terms of capital, with an average of 63 billions worth of wholesales per year (“US Census Bureau QuickFacts: Los”). In addition to the pure industrial progress, Downtown Los Angeles attracted multiple financial institution, expediting the money flow and financial activities. The industrial and financial growth sparked the entertainment field. From Hollywood to Disneyland, people in Los Angeles were able to enjoy the cultural flourishment from their hard work. The symbiotic relationship between industrial and entertainment plays a critical role throughout Los Angeles’ development. Thanks to the fertile bedrock and reputation for industrial development accumulated during the past century for Los Angeles, now this area hold homes for some of the largest corporations in the world. However, the difference between Downtown Los Angeles and the typical towns in US does not limit to population and productivity.
  
  I spent my past four years for high school in Gwinnett – the second largest county in the state of Georgia. The overarching difference is the population density – the key factor for a city distinguished from a suburb. Gwinnett County has more than 400 square miles with a population just short of one million. Los Angeles only has 30 more squared miles in the area compared to Gwinnett county but has close to four million in population (“US Census Bureau QuickFacts: Gwinnett”). A drastic difference in population density limits the standard of living since the relative price of real estate rises as land becomes correspondingly more expensive. This reduction in living space is easy to see from the type of typical households in Los Angeles and Gwinnett county: apartments and condo versus ranch – style home with a front and backyard. The high population density in downtown Los Angeles inflates the value of living spaces, while millionaires can enjoy their luxury apartments, those who struggle over poverty lines have no choice but to live on the street, therefore responsible for difference in income level among its residents. 

  The difference income level formulates two groups of residents in Downtown Los Angeles: heads of business and underprivileged who struggles over poverty. This divergence in income level remains throughout the construction of the city as a research done by Robert J. Sampson concludes: “residential income inequality is alive and well in Los Angeles” (Sampson). In addition, this research highlights the two representative groups at either end of living quality scales: “In Los Angeles, the main story is one of the white spatial advantage over Asians, blacks, and Latinos” (Sampson). Due to limited land spaces, overall price of households in downtown Los Angeles is approximately more expensive than the suburban counterpart, with a two bedrooms condo in downtown easily exceeding $1 million dollars, which can purchase more than three five-bedrooms houses in Gwinnett county. To the affluent multimillionaires, housing does not pose a problem for them; to the while collar middleclass, they can commute to work from suburban area in exchange of lower real estate rates. For those who struggles around the poverty line, they could neither afford to live in decent housings downtown, nor to commute back and forth; therefore, the only choice for them is to rerun in underdeveloped tenants, or go homeless in the worst case. Minorities, largely from immigration and with relatively inadequate education level, suffers most severely from the income differences. More than 43% of all immigrants are in or near poverty. On the other hand, the national average is around 30% (Camarota). The limitation in education level restrains their careers as hard labors or servants, responsible for the low incomes they receive. Furthermore, many immigrants face underpaid work due to their illegal status (thus cannot report to authorities in order to avoid deportations). The difference in income level solidifies the two distinct groups of residents in downtown Los Angeles area. Government executes gentrification to force poor people to move out the area, such as hostile architectures, in the attempt to increase its land values and to attract more visitors. 
  
  As part of gentrification plan to improve the overall safety and appearance of this area, downtown Los Angeles implants numerous hostile architecture in its public spaces, aiming specifically for homeless people. The most pervasive form of hostile architecture is located in the public facilities, mainly chairs and benches that are designed specifically to prevent from laying down.

This is a bench from a public park in downtown Los Angeles. The rightmost “seat” in this picture has a slanted surface that differs from the other flat ones. The oddly shaped “handguard” stands out in the middle of the bench. Such “artistic” design ensures that no one can sleep on this bench. In the name of public space and artistic values, these hostile architectures take away the last hint of humanity the city holds for the homeless. Karl de Fine Licht, a professor in Chalmers University of Technology, reveals the consequence of such defensive architecture: “where it is a clear sign of disrespect, and where people’s rights, on the whole, are violated” (fine). Despite the criticism, the government promotes such implementation as part of the gentrification plan to improve the overall appearance of the community. Gentrification, by renovating tenants in the poor neighborhoods, effectively increases the land value in these areas and hence more rents from affluent residents. Consequently, the original residents are displaced due to high rent or increase in living cost with low compensations. An article in LA Times articulates the helpless moment a resident confronts: a $20,000 vacate fee that can only cover the difference for two and half years while another displaced resident, Chris Vielma, questions: “How are they making it better by getting rid of some people who enjoy being in this area?” (“As”). The standoff between the original resident and the influx of affluent new owners contributes partially to the distant and indifferent interpersonal relationship formed in downtown Los Angeles. 

  The income difference, as well as the gentrification plan forces two groups of residents together at downtown Los Angeles, producing a guarded and indifferent atmosphere around the streets. I take a walk in my neighborhood daily in the evening for the past two years in Gwinnett county. I got to say hello to my neighbors as well as cars driving by. This friendly environment seems to be wiped away when I come to Los Angeles for college.

On the subway, passengers try their best to avoid eye contact to each other and on the streets, people are most likely to turn “deaf” to any attempt for a conversation. While I was on the subway one day, I noticed that there was an African American man sleeping on the subway seats. We can see that he only took two seats and there are plenty seats available next to him. However, no one (including me) was willing to take the seat. The window to the next coach implies that this sub is quite crowded and people shown on the left and right edge of the photo support this idea. The crowded train and the empty seats around that man formed the contrast in this photo. I suspected that this man is homeless and metro seats provided him a place to rest (due to the hostile architectures in the previous paragraph). The photo illustrates a guarded and cautious atmosphere in the metro coach and is an epitome of the hostility in downtown Los Angeles. The “feeling of distance” is subjective to each person’s view. However, a research conducted by Professor Zachary B. Hawley in Texas Christian University presents the relationship between population density and social interaction. The study concludes: “Social interaction with neighbors or groups largely decreases as population density increases.” (Hawley). Downtown Los Angeles, as explained in previous paragraph, experience high population density during daytime, which becomes a contributing factor to the reserved environment. 

  The scarcity in living space motivates people to move out of the city and commute to work in downtown. The census indicates that while with only 35,000 residents, downtown Los Angeles experiences a daytime population over 200,000 (“US Census Bureau QuickFacts: Gwinnett”). Consequently, such a large flow of population on a daily basis poses tremendous pressure for the public transportation system. Compared to the average commute time nationwide of 49 minutes, the average time in Los Angeles reaches 54 minutes, bringing Los Angeles to one of the most stressful commutes in the U.S. (“Survey”). Like a filter, the distance between suburb and downtown Los Angeles separates white-collar workforce with stable income and those underprivileged who cannot afford suburban housing and commuting vehicles. To exhibit the unique heritage of downtown residents, governments painted many murals on the route of the mass transport, while ignoring the accessibility of these arts.
  
  Despite the positive impacts of murals in the community, the accessibility to these murals is extremely limited due to physical barriers and locations for these artworks. The concept of public availability separates murals and other forms of artwork. Like a billboard, a mural radiates its meaning to the residents in that community.

When I was on the metro to Pershing Square, I saw a series of murals near Pico Station. However, traveling at 40 miles per hour, I cannot see the murals until I took a photo on my phone. These murals have a central topic of the city of Los Angeles as well as its landmarks and artistic values. I have only around three seconds to take this picture. From the picture, we can see that the street is completely empty, without any person or cars. In addition, it is unlikely for any passenger to see the murals clearly due to the speed of the metro and most passengers are looking at their cellphones. Therefore, these murals lack the audiences they need to propagate the cultural heritage of Los Angeles. Regardless of the form of separation, a large portion of murals in downtown Los Angeles has become the playground for graffiti writers due to the lack of maintenance.  

  The symbiotic relationship between murals and neighborhood solidifies the unique culture of such. The diversity of population in downtown Los Angeles is the incubator for a versatile form of art, typically murals. Unlike paintings or other artworks that are displayed in a climate-controlled museum, murals convey ideas in a more public fashion. 
  
 ![Victor Clothing Mural](images/Lin_victor_mural.jpg)

Figure 4 - Mural highlighting actor Antony Quinn in the old Victor Clothing Building (Photo taken by Yubin Lin)
   {:.caption}
   
From this photo I took in downtown Los Angeles, the mural highlights the famous actor: Anthony Quinn, as well as the Victor Clothing Company. Both the actor and the company emphasize a strong Hispanic background: Antony Quinn was born in Mexico and developed his career in Los Angeles, while the clients for Victor Clothing company mainly were mainly Latinos. This mural is located in on the wall of now-closed Victor Clothing building on the 3rd street in Los Angeles, which is populated by Latino residents. The location of the mural corresponds with the idea expressed on the mural: to Honor Latino people and companies. In the article “Mainstreaming Murals”, author Judy Vannais explores the purpose behind such murals: “ (murals) celebrate ethnic identity and give popular expression and a sense of pride to marginalized inner-city communities” (Vannis). With the wave of gentrification, many Latino communities lose its sense of belonging by replacing their traditional stores and restaurants with modern fine dining services, and murals, shown in public, reminding other residents the cultural heritage of these ignored Latino residents. Thus the murals and the communities tie together to generate resonance for the amplification of its cultural values. Nonetheless, a mural covered with vandalisms cannot express any ideas as the information is overwritten.

  Murals need constant maintenance to preserve their color, therefore their meanings. Due to poor maintenance issues, many murals in Downtown Los Angeles have become the drawing pad for graffiti painters. Painting graffiti arts is illegal in the city of Los Angeles because of its violation of property rights, especially those of utility structures. Compared to lamp posts and power poles, old murals present perfects location for graffiti paintings: large, flat surfaces, as well as public locations to gain attractions.

On the back of the same building for Victor Clothing Company murals, there is another mural demonstrating the spirit of sports events. The paint on the mural has faded over time and a large portion of the mural is covered by graffiti arts that completely cover the mural. A study explains the possible motives behind the vandalism of murals: “Opponents consider them (these murals) as attempts to impose a singular identity on a heterogeneous community of people and even as acts of intimidation, offering warnings to stay out or beware of the force behind the image.” (McCormick). While murals honor some cultures and heritages or a particular group of residents, others resident may interpret as a stereotype on this group. The collision between traditional habits and the idea of diversity generates graffiti arts as a protest to the profiling of ethnicity groups. In addition, many murals come from government funding, subject to intentional vandalism as a protest to the government, thus acquiring political significance as well. 

  The rich ethnical background as well as its physical location brings downtown Los Angeles both diversity and financial inflows. The cultural variety aids the creation of numerous murals, despite problems with access and vandalisms. Income difference in downtown LA provokes an atmosphere indifference, as well as hostile architectures targeted to the underprivileged ones. All these factors incubates a multifaced downtown Los Angeles, artistic and vibrant, while lacking interpersonal connection. Under the energetic surface, class conflict is rooted deep into this area’s territory, but we chose to ignore it. As the lyric from The Sound of Silence says: “People hearing without listening”.
