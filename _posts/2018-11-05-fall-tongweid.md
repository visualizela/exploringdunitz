Not many would think of University Park as their first destination of travel when there are more reported hold-ups near the prominent Shrine Auditorium than the events happening in it, and when there are more negative reviews about air conditioning in a Victorian-era house than the publicity of the lively cultural atmosphere surrounding it. Indeed, it can be hard for an outsider to discern the inherent cultural and historical diversity of the University Park neighborhood through its blemish regarding crime and poverty. In fact, its cultural richness is a product of social and economic changes in the past century. The neighborhood has also been enjoying the vast possibilities that the University of Southern California brings in its investment in the revitalization of the neighborhood. However, the underlying wealth disparity and subsequent issues within the community still loom large when demographic and economic changes promise the betterment of a community with a frail economic foundation.

The socioeconomic environment in the past century has largely contributed to the community’s cultural diversity that is palpable in virtually every corner of it. In the early twentieth century, the rapid development in southern LA made the neighborhood one of the most desirable residential areas in the city. After the ban of the racial restrictive covenant in 1940s, African Americans began to move into the region, at which point, however, racial conflict began to rear its ugly head. Following the change in the immigration law in 1965, a large Latino population was drawn by the neighborhoods’ low rents. Asians were also common among immigrants. In the 1990 census, Latinos have become the majority in South LA, while African Americans, Asians, and Caucasians also constitute large portions of the ethnicities. Overall, the abolishment of racially discriminative or insensitive laws and affordable housing shaped a number of racially mixed communities such as the University Park neighborhood. Today, one could still see traces of the changing cultural climate in neighborhood. Many elegant old-fashioned houses and historic buildings have marked the community’s early stage of development and become the city’s historical monuments; the omnipresent graffiti and street arts show insights into the hip-hop cultures in 1970s; and an array of exotic cuisines and marketplaces on the streets provide different cultural experiences. The social changes over the course of the history of Los Angeles have formed this culturally diverse community that one sees today.

Although bearing a different character from that of the University of Southern California (USC), the adjoining University Park neighborhood arguably came into life with the founding of the university. After USC was founded in 1881, the North University Park neighborhood had seen an influx of residents. The construction of streetcar routes in 1891 to the downtown attracted some prominent citizens to build large mansions here, thus expediting the neighborhood's transition from its arid and rural origin. Students and faculty members also constituted some of the residents of the area. Therefore, it can be said that the University Park neighborhood shares its root with USC, and, rising from a single Italianate wooden structure to one of the leading private research universities in the world, USC has been constantly infusing fresh blood into the community with its students from all over the world. A sphere of cultural exchange and communication is distinctively tangible in the community, which has played an important role in making diversity a defining feature of the University Park community. The bond between USC and its nearby neighborhoods existed all the way along.

The continual outreach programs and schemes initiated by USC have addressed several issues in the surrounding community and thus created an unyielding unity between USC and its neighborhoods. Every year, roughly half of the USC students engage in community-related services and programs that encompass education, sport, recreation, health care, and so forth. Formal projects such as New Occupations For Life, Neighborhood Academic Initiative, Community Action on Food Environments sought to redress issues of gang crimes, unemployment (education), healthful food access respectively in the surrounding neighborhoods. Besides, the opening of USC village would further serve to alleviate the community’s straits in housing and unemployment. Despite the mounting public pressure of relocation after the 1965 Watt Riot, USC decided to stay largely owing to its commitment to the neighborhoods. Indeed, many have ascribed the fact that USC was left all but unscathed in the aftermath of the 1992 large-scale riot in South LA to its dedication to the communities. Although the riot was instigated by an escalated racial incident, rioters around USC were likely persuaded to spare the place or saw no reason to target the institute. Collaboration is what shapes a truly diverse community and forms the unbreakable bound in-between Every social groups going by their own business merely creates a semblance of harmony, which may be breached by a trigger as simple as a fight in the local bar because there is always an insidious tension. The importance of collaboration becomes all the more evident if one were to think of the sheer contrast between the harmony exhibited in the outreach efforts and the unduly, misdirected violence emanating from the 1965 and the 1992 riots, while both the outreach program and the riots can be viewed as interactions between different cultural groups in one sense. The socioeconomic divide between USC and its surrounding community would have been especially perceptible without USC’s outreach programs. It is the spontaneous collaboration between the University Park community and USC that maintains peace even during times of unrest. 
   
Nevertheless, with diversity comes the inevitable existence of wealth disparity, which reflects existing social issues in the University Park community. As shown in the statistics on the LA Times (Fig. 2), the $18,533 median household income is considered as low for both the city and the county, which is the second-lowest in the LA county. In contrast, USC, as a post-secondary¬¬¬ education institute in the neighborhood, has an estimate of $69,711 for its annual attendance cost, almost four times the community’s median income. This coincides with the fact that the majority of USC students come from other relatively affluent communities. Looking at a big picture outside the USC, the 2000 U.S. census data have indicated a high percentage of families with children in poverty, compared with that of the City of Los Angeles, and yet in the same census, the job-to-worker ratio of the University Park area is high as well. Such a seemingly unusual combination suggests the presence of non-residents. Employers may have a tendency of recruiting people outside of the neighborhood. This shortage of local worker supply is indicative of skill mismatch, which seems particularly true as regards the abundant high-inc¬¬¬ome positions according to the table in Fig. 3. It can be explained by a low attainment of advanced education (i.e. college or above) of adults over twenty-five years old in the 2016 community survey (Fig. 4), which excludes them from certain occupations. Thus, it can be concluded that the wealth disparity exists primarily between some permanent residents and temporary or itinerant population (e.g. students and workers who live in other neighborhoods) and is likely caused by a high percentage of skill mismatch and undereducated population.

Having a less-than-average median household income, the poor part of the community has been faced with deficiency in both education and housing. In 2009, the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD)'s decision to dismiss 3,500 teachers due to budget deficit more or less ruptured its relations with the communities and stirred anxiety among local schools. The poignant reality was writ large from the words of a ninth-grader at Crenshaw High School: “We don’t take our education seriously because, what’s the point? We’re not going to get anywhere anyway. Most of the teachers don’t care and our text books are so out of date that they don’t make sense.” (Medina) It is no coincidence that the schools in impecunious regions that also “happen to be racially diverse” (Emily) are the ones with the lowest test scores, when educational resources are far from equally distributed. The lack of sufficient resources unnerved the students in the less affluent areas, which bore the brunt of the incident. Such a vicious cycle would continue to tag the label of underperformance onto the poor. In light of this, education is distorted from a pathway to escape poverty to an indication of the inequality itself. The disproportion in housing quality also presents a problem. A vendor stated during the interview that the rent doubled over the past 16 years and that it is much harder for the locals to afford housing. As observed in USC’s 2015 State of Neighborhood Report, the presence of students has put a pressure on the rental price, and while a third of student multiunit housing was reasonably hygienic, only eleven percent of the local community counterpart was equally so. After all, the underlying issue is the undeniable financial differences between USC students and non-student residents, which appears conspicuous in the University Park neighborhood where a lot of students have elected to live. Consequent upon persistent homeless and education issues are internecine scenarios such as crimes directed towards students and innocent people. In either case, more aid and attention should be directed towards those in need to achieve an even allocation of resources.

In recent years, the trend of gentrification and the subsequent demographic changes in the University Park neighborhood over the recent years has provoked anxiety in some local residents. Some residents revealed that promotional brochures of newly constructed housing units seem to be expecting white residents. It was also reported by the locals that rents were increased by landlords in an attempt to draw money from college students. One resident said: “We want things like... a new laundromat on the corner of Whittier and Boyle. We want our streets and sidewalks fixed. We shouldn’t have to wait until white people live here for someone to care enough to fix the sidewalks.” (Barragan) The concern here is not so much the rift between different races as one of many controversial sides of gentrification process. As promising as the benefits brought by gentrification seem, such as a reduction of crime rate, better infrastructures, and diversity in a sense, its adverse impact on housing affordability, inequality, and social conflict is nonetheless unquestionable. This is partly due to some local developers and shopkeepers’ attempts to attract and profit from wealthier residents. What ensues is likely a loss of identity felt by the original residents, as they suffer from a loss of social network in the midst of displacement of lower income families. Gentrification can be an inevitable part of a community which constantly changes, but it is by no means the only resort to the community’s renewal.

A checkered history marks the University Park neighborhood: its historic and cultural significance in the first half of the twentieth century has been more or less shaded by a number of social issues at the lowest ebb of its economy. Diversity forms both the frame of the University Park community and the basis of its issues. Thankfully, USC, as an inseparable part of this community, has been conducting neighborhood research programs, and in so doing, proposing future strategies for economic stability, health care, housing, and education. In recent years, the centuries-old neighborhood is on the cusp of renovations led by the city authorities. One could only hope that the neighborhood would once again thrive and extricate itself from the straits it has been in.
