“What is the city but the people?” [5]. Though spoken to the people of Rome, this truth applies to cities regardless of time and place. When a city is founded, there exist principles held by the citizenry, which, over time, change as the citizenry itself changes. The change is often attributed to demographic shifts, whether through immigration, aging, or some other factor. Since its founding, West Hollywood’s distinct culture has faded. The city’s relationship with the LGBTQ community, its founding principles, and modern culture have induced this. Although West Hollywood was founded as a haven for the gay community, the growing widespread acceptance of the group, as well as the attempt to commercialize them have caused the city to lose some of its unique LGBTQ identity. The city has been less than successful in living up to its founding intentions to keep rent low, as well as to maintain its long-time citizenry. Thus, the culture has formed a new culture by adopting contemporary political views and a shared identity with the Los Angeles area.


It is impossible to understand the culture and evolution of West Hollywood without first understanding the history of the LGBTQ community in the area. Before its official founding in 1984, West Hollywood was an unincorporated region of Los Angeles County, well-known for its ‘countercultural’ appeal: musically, socially, and sexually. The West Hollywood official tourism website provides details regarding how the city made an impact right at its founding, by “electing a city council with an openly gay majority … West Hollywood soon developed a reputation as a self-governed gay city and became a vanguard for progressive legislation, social change and LGBTQ culture” [7] Those in the LGBTQ community considered this a great step forward in their movement, and thus, a great amount of unity in West Hollywood revolves around the queer identity. That being said, ethics have changed drastically with regard to sexuality in the four decades since WeHo’s founding. It is only natural that the city’s culture has been affected by this change.


In recent decades, West Hollywood has begun to face a dilution of its culture brought about by the development of sexual ethics in the United States. Since the 1980’s, the nation has undergone cultural changes regarding what is considered sexually normal or acceptable. The cultural shifts associated with this change are almost innumerous: LGBTQ have more representation in film, television, and fictional writings; more openly LGBTQ persons are running for public office; and moral support for issues such as same sex marriage has risen in every demographic group, well surpassing majority support in the United States [2]. All in all, public perception of queer people has become more positive and more widespread. While this is favorable for those in LGBTQ communities such as West Hollywood, it presents an interesting consequence for the city. Because queer sexuality has become more common and widely accepted, WeHo has lost some of the uniqueness with which it was once associated. It's like the old saying “If everyone is special, no one is.” In an age where more and more towns have queer city counselors and gay communities, West Hollywood simply doesn’t stand out as it once did.


It is common, whenever an initially cult institution or practice morphs into the mainstream, that there exists an attempt to make the practice or institution less polarized and therefore more accessible to the general public. The West Hollywood Pride Festival suffered from this in the past year. “Christopher Street West this year tried to rebrand the event as a music festival, saying it was trying to appeal to millennials. It raised ticket prices and … shortened free events dedicated to transgender people and lesbians’’ [1] This reveals West Hollywood’s financial incentive to commercialize an aspect of its culture. The effort to do so, however, forces a more neutral approach to the issue, and rips away much of the festival’s once unique character. This contradicts the very founding of West Hollywood, which was enacted to promote and protect a unique identity.


Although the queer community played a large role in the town’s founding, other drives, economic in nature, influenced the city’s founding identity. One immediate motivation regarded rent control. In the 1980’s LGBTQ people began to flee from persecution in Los Angeles to West Hollywood. Concurrently, many Russian Jews settled in the city after fleeing the USSR. As a result, West Hollywood, at that point still an unincorporated region of LA county, experienced a great influx of new residents, sending rent prices skyrocketing. The city’s founding council intended to curb this by “immediately passing a series of rent control measures to protect its longtime citizens” [1]. This reveals two objectives with the same solution of rent control, first, the economic goal of keeping rent costs low in the face of an increased housing demand. The second, accompanying, goal was socially-minded; maintaining a population of long time residents, especially to protect its minorities.


According to the current real estate market, West Hollywood did not succeed at avoiding rent increases. Although not the highest rent in the area, WeHo’s prices rest near $1446 per month, well above the average $1241 per month in Los Angeles county [6]. While this is ironic, considering the founding of the city was predicated on a need to keep rent low, there is only so much that can be done by a city council facing the forces of time and shifting economic circumstances. Admittedly, the difference between rent in West Hollywood and Los Angeles generally is not dramatic compared to other parts of the country, however the higher rent prices do signify a disconnect between the past and present cultures of the area. While WeHo residents then were mostly minorities who were seeking protection from an inflated market, the modern residents are among the upper class of Los Angeles.


The second objective that accompanied the founding of WeHo dealt with sustaining a population of long time residents. The neighborhood with a rich history of counterculture ironically commenced its incorporated life by immediately moving to protect its own citizenry. One might think that the city, whose mission statement  now stresses the importance of a diverse community [1], would be more inclined to accrue new demographics as frequently as possible. One might assert that WeHo has fostered well its migrant population, which comprises 36% of the city [3], just above the average in the area. This figure, however, doesn’t provide any insight as to the status of the specific communities of immigrants in the city.


The condition of WEHO’s Russian population provides further evidence of the fading culture of West Hollywood. According to the LA Weekly, the Russian population is shrinking due to increased costs of living, as well as a cultural disconnect felt between generations of the Russian immigrants [4]. This has some obvious implications: if the Russian population continues to shrink, the city will lose a very unique subculture, one not widespread in the country. A less obvious consequence of the diminishing amount of Russians, however, has to do with the relationship between the city and its people. This issue is applicable to any decrease in a population which has characterized an area for a significant portion of time and is articulated by Zmudzinska-Nowak, M. in an article on the impact of globalization and commercialization on smaller communities. “In this time of globalization and commercialization of space, cities are facing a serious crisis that is reflected in a sense of alienation, threat or indifference to space. One may quote here Dutch architect and urban planner Cornelis Van Eesteren’s statement that no city shall ever be better or more beautiful than the society that creates it (Somer, 2007).” [8] The decline in the Russian population instills a loss of relationship between city and inhabitants. As more people move out, the decades of culture poured into the neighborhood suddenly vanishes, and the new population is faced with restarting the cycle.


In recent decades, West Hollywood’s culture has been shaped by broad progressive politics. This piece of art is demonstrative of the city’s political views. It displays the word “America,” with each letter engrossing various scenes or images with political implications. The ‘A’ depicts the seal of ICE, the federal office tasked with border and immigrant regulation. This is immediately proceeded by a depiction of President Trump with members of the KKK. The image reveals the unsurprising left-leaning political nature of the neighborhood. It does so, however, in a broad manner, espousing opinions on national political issues rather than concerns about West Hollywood. Although it does speak somewhat to immigration, the implied focus is not on WeHo’s communities of immigrants, but on the president. It bears little local relevance.

Although there is a visible disconnect between the past and present West Hollywood, the town has evolved a modern culture of its own. Without the bus, a policeman is running. Behind him stands a crowd of unique caricatures. The bus itself stands as the optimistic outlook of people who come to West Hollywood, represented by the tourists in the bus, but also of the residents, represented by the caricatures in the bus. The crowd also represents the people of West Hollywood, flaunting the great diversity of their population. Furthermore, the bus is symbolic of the tourist industry, feeding off of the shock felt by many tourists when visiting. The symbolism of the police officer is more ambiguous. He could be running away from the crowd, implying the somewhat romantic notion of overpowering traditional authority. On the other hand, the officer could be running towards something completely unrelated. What’s certain is that the mural is meant to be a new vision of what West Hollywood is. Despite its changes, the town still desires to be regarded as a hub of the counterculture.

With time, West Hollywood has merged a part of its identity with that of the greater Los Angeles area. This is owed in part to the commercialization and fame that leaks from LA into WeHo (as is the case with any metropolitan center). Many street paintings reveal the shadow of Los Angeles in the city. For example, figure 2 illustrates a city bus, advertising “#OverachieveLA,” with its destination set on the future, indicative of the mutualistic relationship between LA and West Hollywood. This is also visible in figure 3, which shows a painting of angel wings in WeHo. This is perhaps the image most indicative of the Los Angeles area. As the city welcomes more tourist, whereby it benefits economically, it’s identity expands to incorporate the LA area.	Although West Hollywood has lost a part of its former identity with its immigrant population and the LGBTQ community, the city has formed a new, optimistic culture which incorporates its own values and remains a part of the culture of the area at large. As the LGBTQ culture and its values have become more widely accepted, the city is less of a haven for that community. The city was not able to keep up with maintaining its low rent over the years. Likewise, time has reduced the Russian culture to almost a memory. Despite this, West Hollywood’s culture has evolved into a new identity, incorporating incoming immigrant populations, political visions, and economic hopes. It is often said that one must let go of their old identity before they can embrace the future. With regards to cities and communities, it is important to bear this in mind. As progress is made, former practices, whether good or bad, will fade away.
