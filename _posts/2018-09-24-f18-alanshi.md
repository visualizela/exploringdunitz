Nestled between Santa Monica and Beverly Hills, West Los Angeles is an urban oasis resplendent with trendy shops, chic apartments, and gourmet restaurants. Its low rate of homelessness is declining further, and the remaining homeless will live in proposed housing built by the city. However, a closer look reveals that the homeless population has been cast aside and excluded from society. On the surface, West LA’s affluent, liberal residents promote philanthropy and inclusivity, but their practices of hostile architecture and isolated homeless communities have resulted in limited accessibility to the neighborhood and segregation between the wealthy and the poor. Home prices and rent in LA rise nearly every year, and West LA stands out as one of the most expensive neighborhoods in an already pricey city. Further contributing to West LA’s air of exclusivity, hostile architecture such as barbed wire and public benches with center armrests to prevent sleeping are commonplace. The city’s homeless housing project on the Veteran Affairs campus quarantines the homeless from the rest of the neighborhood in an undesirable, barren location. To understand how West LA became such an exclusive neighborhood with contradictory behaviors towards the homeless, one must start with its history.

West Los Angeles began as humble cattle ranch many years before it matured into the wealthy enclave it is today. In the 19th century, Mexican Californio landowners controlled Rancho San Vicente and Santa Monica, which encompassed the area now known as West Los Angeles. In the aftermath of the Mexican-American War, white settlers bought out the Californio-owned ranches and converted them to fields of wheat and beans. With the arrival of Japanese immigrants in the early 1900s, a small but significant Japanese community grew around Sawtelle Boulevard. The City of Sawtelle was soon incorporated, and later annexed by the City of Los Angeles during the 1920s (“Neighborhood History”). Currently, West LA remains a white-majority neighborhood; an LA Times census reports that roughly 77% of West LA residents are white, with Asians forming the second largest ethnic group, at 11% (“Mapping LA: West Los Angeles,” 2018). The transformation from West LA from a primarily Hispanic to a not particularly diverse white neighborhood also resulted in a rather homogenous socioeconomic landscape. 

As evidenced by their high levels of education and median income, as well as their Democratic political leanings, residents of West LA tend to be affluent and liberal, projecting an image of philanthropy and inclusion. The LA Times census found that 60.4% of West LA residents aged 25 and older have 4-year college degrees, and that the median household income stands at $86,403 (“Mapping LA: West Los Angeles,” 2018).  Given its large concentration of highly educated, wealthy inhabitants, West LA is one of the most well-heeled neighborhoods in the city. With well above average incomes, West LA’s citizens actively donate to charitable causes as well as political campaigns. During the 2016 presidential election, 89.5% of political donors from West LA contributed to Hillary Clinton’s campaign (“Los Angeles is With Hillary,” 2016). The overwhelming majority of Democrats in West LA are likely to support liberal candidates who advocate for sanctuary cities and housing for the homeless. Despite its inclusive political climate, however, West LA’s home prices and rent restrict who can afford to live there. 

High home prices surging year after year make West LA a largely unaffordable community that caters mainly to the wealthy. Located in LA’s desirable west side, near the beach and the entertainment capital of Hollywood, West LA’s competitive housing market keeps its prices higher than the norm in LA. According to Dr. Selma Hepp, an economist at a California brokerage company, the median home price for Los Angeles as a whole is $939,500 for 2018, while the median home price in West LA is $1.225 million. Furthermore, West LA homes have a year-to-date median price increase of 20% (Paris, 2018). One would have to be a millionaire to afford even a typical home in LA. Even though homes in LA are already more than quadruple the national median of $221,500, West LA’s even higher home prices epitomize the exclusivity of the area (“United States Home Prices,” 2018). Put into perspective, half of all homes in West LA cost more than $1.225 million, which is only affordable for the top 1% or 2% of the population. The majority of people who cannot afford a home are likely to rent an apartment, but unfortunately apartment rent is no better.
   
With its already high rent growing higher every year, West LA does not provide many palatable options for anyone seeking apartments. The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in 2015 was $1700 while the rent in 2016 rose to $2150 (Kudler, 2015; Chiland, 2017). For a whole year, the rent adds up to over $25,000, a sizeable chunk of a working-class income, thus barring blue-collar workers from living in West LA. This 23.5% increase in rent year over year underscores the fact that West LA is also becoming more unaffordable over time. The yearly percentage increase in rent mirrors the annual 20% growth in home prices. Anyone looking for a cheap house or an apartment would be out of luck in West LA, as a tolerable price one year would grow to an exorbitant sum the next. Over time, only the wealthiest citizens will be able to continue living in West LA, leaving the poor looking for somewhere else to live. There is no way a homeless person can dream of affording even the cheapest West LA apartment. Adding insult to injury, the neighborhood’s residents and city officials have implemented defensive measures meant to keep the homeless out.

The application of hostile architecture to benches and fences around West LA makes the neighborhood even less accessible, exemplifying the protective mentality of the residents. “Meshing social engineering with civil engineering,” hostile architecture employs exclusionary design elements to public areas to discourage undesired behaviors (Swain, 2013). Public benches such as the one shown in Figure 1 line the streets of West LA, and provide a place to sit for those waiting for a bus. At first glance, the armrest in the middle of the bench appears to be a thoughtful design for the weary arms of city-goers, but its hidden intention is to prevent the homeless from sleeping on the bench. The armrest serves as a deterrent both physically and psychologically, making sleeping on the bench conveniently uncomfortable while sending a message to the homeless that they are unwanted and do not belong in the community. Figure 2 is an image of another deterrent: barbed wire on a fence surrounding an apartment complex and a storefront. Similar to the bench with center armrest, the barbed wire fence acts not only as a man-made barrier to the homeless and petty thieves, but also makes the neighborhood feel less welcoming. It is an outright display of fortified protection against the perceived dangers of burglaries and other potential crimes often associated with the homeless. Typically, barbed wire appears more fit for prison grounds than a residential community. Its use in West LA signifies the high priority its residents place on maintaining their safety, at the expense of reduced aesthetics. In their attempt to preserve the elegance of the neighborhood by barring the homeless, they have actually diminished its visual appeal with hostile architecture. To a certain degree, West LA is ironically imprisoning itself by shunning outsiders with ugly security measures. Despite all its support for Democrats and the liberal value of inclusivity, West LA appears to be intent on keeping the homeless and poor out. But dealing with the homeless issue is more complicated than it appears.

The bench and barbed-wire fence have reinforced West LA’s status as an exclusive neighborhood that views homelessness as a problem to be avoided. From the perspective of the West LA residents, hostile architecture achieves the goal of protecting their hard-earned quality of life. Given that 4 in 10 homeless people nationwide have a serious drug addiction or severe mental illness, it is not hard to understand why the wealthy residents tend to view the homeless as a potential threat to the community (“Homeless Crisis on the West Coast,” 2017). The concerns of West LA’s residents are echoed in the voices of people in other neighborhoods impacted by LA’s homeless crisis. A man from South LA interviewed by the LA Times complained that homelessness was “tearing down [his] community,” and families reported homeless encampments littered their yards with “feces and hypodermic needles” (Smith, 2018). In light of such safety threats, one cannot blame West LA’s residents for taking a self-protective stance, because people deserve a safe place to live and raise their families. Self-protection is part of human nature, and hostile architecture is but a modern form of scent-marking for territorial boundaries. Nonetheless, from an altruistic perspective, the homeless deserve a helping hand from society. The dilemma lies in the lack of cost-efficient and sustainable options that can help the homeless while maintaining the quality of life in the normal community, not to mention the fact that many homeless may refuse to live in shelters because they do not want to comply with shelter restrictions on drug abuse. There is no easy solution, and West LA residents are torn between their fundamental need for self-protection and the humanitarian call to help the homeless. They undoubtedly realize that something must be done about the homeless, but their “not in my backyard” attitude prevents significant progress from being made.
   Coming from the master-planned community of Irvine, I know firsthand how upscale neighborhoods grapple with the issue of homelessness. Irvine’s almost nonexistent homeless population is due to the ongoing effort of its police department, which combs the streets for homeless people and relocates them to the nearby city of Santa Ana or other areas. Regarding homeless relocation in Los Angeles, research by Vitale (2010) found that the Safer Cities Initiative “may have succeeded in displacing people from Skid Row, but it has not reduced homelessness” and instead “made it more difficult for many people to escape homelessness.” Dealing with the issue of homelessness by making arrests, “especially those that involve charges of drug dealing, make it more difficult [for the homeless] to access social services, employment, and permanent housing” (Vitale, 2010). Initiatives to rid the streets of homeless people only place them out of sight and out of mind, and could create an illusion of decreasing homeless rates in certain communities. In West LA, the number of homeless people decreased from approximately 300 in 2017 to 160 in 2018 (“A 2018 Snapshot of Homelessness,” 2018). Although it is possible that some homeless people may have gotten jobs and found a decent place to live, a more likely reason for the decrease could be that police acting under the Safer Cities Initiative arrested the homeless for “quality of life” crimes (Vitale, 2010). In addition, the decrease in homeless population could also be caused by a migration to an area with less hostile architecture. In either case, the total number of homeless people in LA did not decrease; the homeless were merely moved from one location to another. Planned housing projects for the homeless promise to be an improvement compared to the use of police force, yet still miss the mark in certain aspects.

A proposed solution for a homeless shelter in West LA would provide the homeless with a roof over their heads, but comes with its share of drawbacks as well. Providing aid to the poor and underserved has long been a mainstay of liberal policy, and state officials’ plan to solve the issue of homelessness in West LA is no different. Democratic senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer support “additional housing and services for homeless and disadvantaged veterans at the West Los Angeles Veteran Affairs campus" (“Let Homeless Veterans Live”). Although the cause the senators are championing is commendable, building homeless housing in the Veteran Affairs campus would isolate the homeless from the rest of the city. With the homeless concentrated into a single spot like a ghetto, the senators are knowingly segregating the homeless from the homeowners. This modern-day segregation clashes with the liberal ideals of equality that Democratic senators tend to espouse.

As seen on the map, the proposed housing for the homeless in West LA is in an undesirable location that limits access to the neighborhood. Figure 3 from Google Maps illustrates that the West LA Veteran Affairs campus is on an empty lot right next to the highway and a cemetery, far from the town center, stores, and potential job opportunities that would improve life for the homeless. With no means of transportation, the homeless living in the VA housing would have to walk long distances, crossing through a busy highway and a cemetery to access more populated areas of the city where they could receive help from generous residents. Without convenient access to such resources, the homeless will remain trapped in the cycle of poverty, marooned on the VA campus as if it were a desert island. The proposed housing is a step forward in the right direction, but not a resolution. Providing housing for the homeless enhances their quality of life – definitely a laudable, charitable act – but the relatively remote location of the housing creates additional barriers for the homeless and shows that city officials and local residents are at a loss trying to balance the needs of the homeless and the residents. As a whole, the senators’ plan needs further consideration and revision; in its current state, it is reminiscent of moving a mess into the closet instead of cleaning and organizing an untidy room. 

West LA is a superficially picturesque neighborhood, but looking beyond its upscale charm and enviable living standards exposes an unpleasant underbelly of hostile architecture and exclusionary attitudes toward the homeless. Luxury homes matched with luxury prices prevent nearly anyone who is not in the millionaire club from purchasing a home in West LA. Public city benches equipped with armrests in the middle and barbed wire fences surrounding stores and apartments protect residents, but project an unwelcoming atmosphere. Proposed housing for the homeless on the Veteran Affairs campus provides shelter but lacks opportunities for the homeless to obtain jobs and rise above their destitute living conditions. West LA’s residents are in constant struggle between their primal drive for self-protection and civilized humanitarian desire to help the impoverished. The coexistence of hostile architecture and homeless shelters are the manifestations of this never-ending struggle. But there is hope that altruism can ultimately prevail. As long as community debates and residents’ involvement in the search for better solutions continue, West LA will one day be as beautiful on the inside as it appears on the surface.
