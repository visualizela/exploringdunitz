   Driving through downtown to Hollywood, numerous signs of stores written in Korean appear, giving the Los Angeles Korean community much visibility. Koreatown, located at Central L.A. region of Los Angeles County, is a neighborhood that represents Korean culture (Figure 1). Through keeping their cultural tradition and creating social interactions with their members, Koreans in Koreatown establish strong ethnic attachment. However, the residents in the community are of highly diverse ethnicities, with 32.2% being Asians, 52.5% of being Latinos, and 7.4% being white (Los Angeles Times, 2000). Korean immigrants, especially generation 2 and 3 are under significant influence of American culture which leads to their adoption of certain aspects of American culture. Ethnic identity and adhesive adaption in Koreatown will be depicted in light of the historical background of Korean immigrants, culture preservation and ethnic attachment of the group, and the connection between American and Korean culture. Firstly, this paper will discuss how the history of Korean immigration and their affiliation with Christianity pave the way for their impact on Los Angeles. Secondly, it will show that through maintenance of Korean language, food, and festivals, ethnic attachment is built among Koreans and Korean culture is preserved. Lastly, it will dive into the adjusted Korean culture existed in Koreatown by analyzing the influences of Latinos in the community and modified view on females.

The historical background of Korean immigrants underlies the relationship between Korean and American culture. In the early 1900s, Korean immigrants were first recruited to Hawaii to work on sugar plantations, and later the majority of them migrated to California. In 1910, according to U.S. Census, there were 462 Korean residents in the U.S. and most of them lived in California. The population continued to grow in the 1920s and 1930s. According to U.S. Census, in 2010, the city of Los Angeles contained about 108,282 Korean Americans which was the highest Korean American population of any city proper. The long for better education may serve as one of the explanations why Koreans emigrated to America. Lee Myung-bak, Ex-president of the Republic of Korea, once said, “I still get asked by many foreign leaders, how did a country with no natural resources, no technology, no capital, and no experience manage to achieve so much in just one generation? My answer to them is very simple: the power of education”. It can be seen that education is highly valued in Korea and it explains that the massive scale of immigration made universities in California holds more Koreans than any other state.

	Apart from the historical ties, Koreans’ affinity with Christianity also contributes to their lifestyle and belief that were formed as Korean American. Historical data demonstrates that Korean immigrants have had strong connections with Christianity even before they came to America. In the ship to Honolulu on December 22, 1902, it was “Reverend George H. Jone’s persuasive sermon to entice his congregation members” that convinced people and caused the ship filled to departure from Inchon port (Sunoo, 1977). It can be seen that American missionaries encouraged Koreans to emigrate to Hawaii. Besides, Hurh and Kim (1988) found out that 69.9% of Korean Americans in Los Angeles were related to Korean ethnic churches and 83.5% of them attended church at least once a week. This piece of data echoed with a common saying, “When two Japanese meet, they set up a business firm; when two Chinese meet, they open a Chinese restaurant; when two Koreans meet, they establish a church” (Kim 1983). The reason why attending churches becomes Koreans’ way of life is that Korean churches serve social, psychological, and religious functions. It acts as a social center to meet friends and maintain Korean nationalism, a place for Koreans to realize religious belief, and a harbor that gives emotional support to any feelings that arise due to the new environment (Hurh and Kim, 1988). Overall, Korean immigrants’ church involvement can be seen as a result of the adjustment to American ideas, and they make the change as a new way to find cultural identification in America. 
   
	Koreans in Koreatowns embody strong ethnic connections and identities. Since Koreans migrated to America, they have maintained their culture by starting up Korean businesses, preserving the Korean language, and keeping their traditions. Korean businesses located at Koreatown serve as a center for social interactions between ethnic members to happen and meet the demands of their culturally based co-ethnic members. Korean food, groceries, magazines, and services with unique Korean cultural tastes are provided to benefit their members. Statistics show that in the 20th century, approximately 73% of Korean businesses located in Koreatown serve Koreans as the mast majority of customers, in comparison to 21% of those in other areas of Southern California (Min, 1989). Although the principle target of these businesses today is group of tourists or non-Koreans, it still offers Koreans the sense of home. The Korean signs of the shops and restaurants mark the boundaries of Koreatown. All signs of traditional Korean stores are written in Korean, and some are written in both English and Korean. For instance, the Korean BBQ restaurant “Honey Pig”, one of the top 10 Korean BBQ restaurants in Los Angeles nominated by LA Weekly, only uses Korean sign (Figure 2). In a word, homogenous culture and Korean businesses in Koreatown help to cultivate the distinct ethnic identity of Koreans.

	In addition, on account of their strong sense of ethnic attachment, Koreans are aware of the importance to speak their heritage language. Korean language schools play an integral role in the social structure of the Korean community in Ktown. Most of the Korean children attend public schools in Los Angeles, and language schools serve as the place where the younger generations learn Korean. For instance, Korean Cultural Center, a language school located at Koreatown, provides Korean lessons. As Lara L. commented, “My daughters are 8 months, 3 years, and 5 years old and we speak English at home, but we are Korean /Korean American”. Although this situation is not common among Korean Americans since they are likely to speak English at home, for second or third generations who are poor at their heritage language and are fluent at English, attending Korean language school is a way to revitalize their heritage language. In the study Min conducted, 68% of the Koreatown Koreans answered that they rarely or never speak English at home, while the percentage drops to 47.5% for the respondents settled in other areas of Los Angeles. It implies that nearly two-thirds of Koreatown Koreans speak Korean at home and only less than half of Koreans in other Los Angeles areas do so. Overall, it can be seen that Koreans value their language and culture and this conception bonds them closer. 
   
	Another form of culture maintenance in Koreatown that strengthens Koreans’ attachment is festivals. Koreans celebrates a total of 18 traditional festivals based on lunar month. This cultural tradition persists in America. Annual festivals like LA Korean Festival and KX festivals are held to advocate Korean culture. According to LA Korean Festival’s official website, “in 1974, the Los Angeles Korean Festival Foundation was founded by leaders of the early Korean-American community with the purpose of keeping their Korean roots planted even after immigrating to the United States”. During the festival, traditional Korean food, such as spicy rice cakes, Korean BBQ, mung bean pancakes that incorporate the unique taste of Korea will be provided. Featured activities, fan dancing and Korean drums will be presented on stage. On the field, historical wall, exhibitions of genuine Korean products, and the march of traditional soldiers will enable people, especially the young Korean generation, to have a better understanding of its rich culture. Through celebrating traditional festivals, Koreans will establish a stronger connection and a greater sense of ethnic identity.
   
 	Interestingly, different from Koreans’ homogenous culture, diversity and merge of culture in Koreatown can be demonstrated by the collision and connection between Korean and Latino culture. Latinos, composing 52.5% of Koreatown residents, are highly present in the community and take charge of various working positions. They can be waiters or waitresses in the restaurants, cashier in the grocery stores speaking Korean with the customers, or usher in Korean Karaoke. The critical role Latino workers play in Koreatown leads to social interactions between Koreans and Latinos and later form a connection. An emerging phenomenon that Latinos can speak Korean prevail and vice versa. The creation of Korean tacos that feature classic Mexican food infused with traditional Korean elements symbolizes Asian and Latino American cultural exchange. 
	
	Another culture adaption of Koreans is the perspective change of gender role. Korea, as a country of etiquette, has strict rules on behaviors and words. It is a primarily patriarchal society dominated by male guidance. Korean husbands traditionally work outside, and their wives are responsible to take care of household chores including cooking and cleaning. Although in the twenty-first century, women in Korea work outside of home as well, their status is still considered to be lower than male in the family. However, Korean female in America, especially in Los Angeles, have adjusted their perceptions on gender roles due to the influence of American culture. After Los Angeles riot, a turning point in Korean identity occurs in which Korean immigrants no longer consider themselves Koreans, but Korean Americans. They began to adopt certain aspects of American culture in a way that doesn’t replace their own culture. “While only a small proportion of married women participate in the labor force in South Korea, the vast majority of Korean immigrant wives work outside the home, most working long hours” (Pyong, 2005). This phenomenon demonstrates the step Korean American women took to earn gender equality. In fact, there were a significant number of Korean women who were motivated to migrate to America because they thought of Americans being more respectful to women and allowing them freedom. Ms. Park, a Korean woman who immigrated to America in 1981, said “In Korea they’re disrespectful towards women, so I wanted freedom here …. Because of my family, you know, my father, he acted like a king, he decided everything. It was miserable”. Korean American women have been padding their way to feminism.
   
	Through almost a century, Koreatown has developed into a vibrant, multilingual and dense neighborhood that could only exist in L.A. It injects diversity in L.A, and meanwhile, L.A. shapes the community. It is undeniable that Korean Americans have become an indispensable part of the economic and cultural fabric of Los Angeles. They express distinct ethnic identity by operating Korean businesses, maintaining Korean language and traditions. Whereas, the members in the community also have undergone adhesive adaptations to American culture and established connections with Latino culture. In conclusion, this paper uncovers the historical background of Korean immigrants and further demonstrates ethnic attachment and diversity in Koreatown through the aspects of cultural preservation and the merger between American and Korean culture. With the rapid development constructing in the city, it is hard to imagine how Koreatown will grow and how Korean Americans in Koreatown will transform.
