Imagine you are standing on a cliff looking out at the seemingly endless ocean. Unless you have a Ph.D. in Chemistry, you’re naturally inclined to perceive it as a whole rather than the sum of millions of water droplets, as they all blend together.  Suburbs, seas of residences in their own right, mimic the very same principle. Although an area’s identity as such is dependent on many demographic factors, people tend to imagine a suburb as the stereotypical picture-perfect community of the 1950’s. In spite of this, understanding the demographic factors that constitute a suburb is fundamental to grasping the true nature of any area dubbed a “suburb.” North Hollywood, a neighborhood located in the famed Los Angeles County, is a thoroughly suburban community as seen through its socioeconomic, educational, and racial makeup. Due to the exodus of the middle class from central Los Angeles and the rise in residential buildings in the outskirts of the bustling city, the community of North Hollywood (NoHo) grew and became an increasingly popular place to live. Families specifically were attracted to the predominantly residential community because of the impressive quality and quantity of schools and educational opportunities. Assimilation is a challenge when many new people move into a neighborhood as locals may be unwelcoming and seen to throw racist remarks towards those perceived as outsiders; in attempts to fight the adversity towards diversity and bring unity to the neighborhood, community members have implemented group collaborative projects to bring the community together.
 
While several definitions of the word “suburb” exist,  the majority agree that a suburb is a residential area typically located on the outskirts of a larger city. That said, these definitions only acknowledge the physical aspects of a suburban community while disregarding the cultural and social dimensions that further define suburbia. According to Marco Adelfio (2016), suburbs are stereotyped as lacking social diversity and presenting a homogeneous culture through assimilation of the residents. Suburban inhabitants are presumed to gradually lose their individual culture and identity upon moving to the suburb, and instead settle in and accept the culture of their new community.  The physical structure of the suburb appeals to many planners as developing areas on the edges of a city allows more people to live in said city. 

An exceptional example of such development can be seen in the neighborhood of North Hollywood (NoHo). In 1869, Isaac Lankershim and his agricultural group bought part of the San Fernando Valley (including present day NoHo) and created the Lankershim Ranch Land and Water Company. His son later turned the company into the L.A. Farming and Milling Company that centered its business on growing wheat. When the price of wheat began to fall, his son established the town Toluca and sold small move-in farms to prospective buyers. In 1913, the Los Angeles Aqueduct was built, and many valley farmers wanted to purchase the incoming water; however, the city was barred from selling outside its limits. Thus, the community voted to be incorporated into the city, and changed its name to North Hollywood in order to capitalize on the allure of Hollywood in the real-estate boom. Slowly, housing began to replace the farms and orchards, as the growth of the aviation industry during World War II drew naval and air force members to California, resulting in the suburbanization of North Hollywood.

Accommodations in suburban North Hollywood are more affordable than in many other parts of Los Angeles, families can afford more spacious accommodations and can benefit from the better performing schools and community infrastructure available there. The median household income of the residents of North Hollywood is $50,196, which is about 80% of the average in the United States (Mitchell, 2018).  The average cost of a one bed, one bath apartment in NoHo is $1700 per month compared to $2300 per month for the same size property in Downtown Los Angeles.  The cost of housing in and around Los Angeles is typically much higher than the cost in cities like Las Vegas and Phoenix where similar rental property averages less than $1,000 per month (Mitchell, 2018). Although there are less expensive rentals in the other states the benefits of living in the suburb of NoHo are the relatively lower rent cost, great schools, and access to the job market in Los Angeles. As such, there have recently been changes in the structural composition of the area to accommodate the growing appeal of living in North Hollywood.

The type of buildings and architectural landmarks that formulate a neighborhood often play a direct role in representing the socioeconomic status of the area and its residents. According to Albert, a North Hollywood native of 8 years who agreed to an interview, this physical aspect of the neighborhood has changed over the years. He mentioned that construction in the area is on the rise, particularly the conversion of previously industrial buildings into residential ones. The increase in buildings of this variety certainly encourages the influx of city-working residents with families that are hoping to settle into permanent homes. The influx of such inhabitants has further cemented the neighborhood’s identity as a suburban community. 
Another influential physical feature of the neighborhood is the hostile architecture, including restricted seating. Hostile architecture including that shown in figure 1 is common in suburban neighborhoods to prevent unwanted individuals, primarily the homeless, from loitering in the area. The residents want to keep their bedroom community as just that, a suburbia untainted by the overcrowding of the city.

With a primarily residential neighborhood comes the need for educational opportunities which can play a fundamental role in shaping a community and its residents. In North Hollywood, the pre-university opportunities, including both public and private institutions, are numerous. With five high schools (three of which are private) and fifteen elementary schools to choose to attend, the neighborhood promotes the education of its youth (LA Times). A high abundance of schools is a key indicator of a suburb as families often choose to settle down on the outskirts of a city where they can raise their kids away from bustling city life, but are still able to commute to work.  Along with the accessibility of education, the quality of educational centers marks a distinction between suburbs and urban areas. Research has shown that suburban schools typically have higher standards of education as well as larger than average financial resources per student (Adkins, 1968). One of two public high schools in the neighborhood, North Hollywood Senior High has a California School Rating (CSR) of eight out of ten, reflecting its high quality (school-ratings.com). Quality schools like this, along with the North Hollywood Adult Learning Center, set the neighborhood apart as a suburban community that encourages education for all its residents. 

A third key contributor to a neighborhood’s cultural identity is the racial makeup of its residents. According to the census data shown in Figure 2, the North Hollywood community is predominantly white (47%) and Hispanic (38%), the remainder of the individuals identifying as Asian (7%) and black (5%).

Despite the differing races living in the area, the inhabitants have adopted the single-minded community culture seen in suburbs that shuns differences. The lack of acceptance in deviation from a norm that seems to come with a racially divided community where minorities make up a small fraction of the population comes in the form of racial stereotyping and prejudice. Still, the United States has made great headway towards equality by passing laws and regulations including the Equality Act of 2010. Furthermore, the state of California has been one of the top states leading rising progressive trends that favor equality. While the golden state has been at the forefront of this action for a number of years, racism still persists throughout the state. North Hollywood has had its fair share of incidents of racial prejudice between its community members. Earlier this year, a Hispanic resident of the neighborhood captured a video of a woman telling him she was “tired of Mexicans’ bossy attitudes” when he asked her to pick up after her dog. She told the man to “go back to Mexico” along with other racial insults. This is a deplorable incident that speaks to the societally constructed separation between the racially different residents created by many within the community. In January this year, a similar incident occurred where Jeanne Heo was approached on the metro by a man who yelled racial slurs and degrading insults at her at the North Hollywood stop (Gracie). These unfortunate divisions and toxic beliefs create a less-than-welcoming community for minorities and people of color in which to live. However, the majority of the inhabitants are actively trying to fight the prejudice of a few to create a healthier and welcoming community for all.
  
One of the most effective approaches to eliminating animosity between polarized groups is to create a common goal. In 1974, Judith Bacca proposed the construction of a mural in North Hollywood depicting California’s history. To turn her dream of a half a mile-long mural into a reality, Bacca recruited more than 400 disadvantaged youth and juvenile offenders from many backgrounds to work on the project. Her hope was to unify the community and establish a connection that would last. About the mural and its formation, Bacca stated, “It's not just history, it's really about relationships—about connecting” (Velimirović). Working alongside their neighbors on the mural brought the people of North Hollywood significantly closer. The actual subject portrayed in the mural also promotes community acceptance and connection, as Baca said, “[it is] a giant monument to interracial harmony” (Risling, 2000). Pictured in the mural are various scenes showing the history of California from diverse and marginalized community perspectives, such as the ones shown in Figure 3 depicting Indian assimilation and Jewish involvement in the arts and sciences.  This serves as retaliation to the rejection of diversity and cultural differences that has taken ahold of the neighborhood of North Hollywood.

The overwhelming residential conversion of the community along with the rise in housing prices in central Los Angeles, has led to the influx of commuter parents and their children to the areas on the edge of the city. For residents to move into these areas with families there must be an abundance of high-caliber educational options available, like those found in North Hollywood. The result of a highly residential and tightly packed micro-society is a homogeneous culture that ostracizes those who do not conform, regardless of efforts made by community members to encourage acceptance, tolerance, and diversity. These demographic factors undeniably mark North Hollywood as a suburb through and through. Much like the ocean is composed of droplets, a suburb is composed of a great many factors and truly understanding any suburban area requires studying all of its facets.
