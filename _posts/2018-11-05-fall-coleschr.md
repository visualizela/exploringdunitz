   Earth consists of a complex web of interconnected physical, chemical, and biological processes that form a balance of creation and destruction. Every organism and every community plays its part in an intricate and delicate game of balance. Santa Monica, a coastal city in Southern California, is especially attuned to this balance not only for the environment but also for the community culture. Santa Monica’s largely white middle class demographic shapes and is shaped by the culture of the neighborhood through modern architecture, recreational and innovative industry, and progressive ideals. Newly constructed  buildings appeal to modern middle-class tastes, which in addition to rising costs, stabilizes the white middle class demographic as the majority in the community and creates a hostile environment for the homeless. The city’s location and sustainable practices attract tourism and innovation, generating economic growth while curtailing economic diversity. Ecological programs, social projects, and youth-centered art demonstrate the progressive, forward thinking ideals of the community.

   Construction is abundant in Santa Monica, where new buildings are designed to appeal to modern tastes. The first thing to notice when visiting is that many of the buildings are cubical, flashy, and sleek—essentially the new trend in modern architecture. Look no farther than the last stop on the metro expo line, where exiting patrons are welcomed into the city by the cheery yellows of the street pavement and bold blue of the Big Blue Bus parking lot wall. Figure 1 displays various buildings from left to right: the hotel Courtyard by Marriott which can be seen right across from the metro stop, an apartment complex near downtown, and a trendy new home near the beach. All three of these living arrangements are typical of Santa Monica in their square modern fashion with an emphasis on glass and greenery. The sleek building design and green residential areas is contingent upon the residents who have the money and the influence on their neighborhood to demand such an atmosphere. Many neighborhoods in Los Angeles do not have the wealth for trendy homes or the space for carefully trimmed lawns, but Santa Monica is clearly on the opposite end of this spectrum.

   In order to keep up with the changing preferences of Santa Monica residents, there is rampant construction in the city. As can be seen in figure 2, Santa Monica has 11 current and 15 proposed construction sites while Long Beach has 10 current and 12 proposed construction sites. Although both cities have similar amounts of construction, Santa Monica has more small scale, likely residential construction sites whereas Long Beach has larger construction projects represented by the large shapes and longer lines of red and green. Larger scale projects are usually taken on by the city and are for public works rather than private residences, which reveals that Santa Monica’s construction is more focused on individual residence and business improvement whereas Long Beach’s construction is more for industry and public good. Recent construction in Santa Monica has yielded modern residences; however, living costs have been increasing at the same time to meet this new standard of housing.

The rising housing costs in Santa Monica have defined the predominant race and class of people living there. In the 1970s, the neighborhood was burdened by “rapidly rising rent levels” after a period of “substantial apartment construction,” so in 1979 renters decided to put a stop to this rapid increase by passing a “local rent control initiative” (Levine, Grigsby & Heskin). While the goal of the rent control ordinance was to protect residents from climbing rent costs, not all residents benefitted equally. After 1979, on average white households spent only 27.5% of their income on rent whereas Latino households spent 37.5% and there were too few black households to have a meaningful sample size (Levine, Grigsby & Heskin). Although rent control fixed the rent in place, rent was already high, and as a result Latino and black households were priced out of the market due to their on average lower income levels. They could not sustainably pay the rent price as easily as the more affluent white families, and over time would be more likely to move out and look for more affordable accommodations. In effect, rent control only aided the better off middle-class white tenants and did not protect the interests of lower income minorities. Housing prices rose by “more than 200%” from 1995 to 2007, compounding the effect of the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The resulting housing deficit displaced more than just ethnic minorities. From 1990 to 2000, Santa Monica registered a 19% decline in people over the age of 60 and a 16% decrease in households earning below the county median income, while the city’s median household income increased by 40% (Kamel). Housing for prospective buyers became even less affordable as prices climbed while housing stock decreased. Meanwhile, many current low-income and elderly residents decided that it would cost more to fix earthquake damages than to move to a more affordable community. Housing cost increases established a hostile market for minorities, lower income groups, and the elderly, much like how the public architecture deters homeless individuals.

With a largely well-off population in Santa Monica, many public amenities have grown to reflect the majority’s desires. The main streets are a prime walking location with their clean pavement, vividly-colored modern buildings, and the shimmery strip of blue on the horizon. Eventually it becomes apparent that one does not encounter many homeless here. Instead they are concentrated on the outskirts of society, huddled together in a secluded corner of the Big Blue Bus parking lot facing the Santa Monica Freeway and around the entrance of the low cost McDonalds. The reason for this unofficial segregation is the hostile architecture of public resting places. Figure 3 portrays a bench with dividers protruding at intervals so that a maximum of three people can sit at a time. This type of construction functions as a deterrent for homeless people who frequently sleep on public benches. With a lack of comfortable public areas to spend the night, the homeless seek other more accommodating locations, which is one way the community has decided to deal with its homeless population. Another example of architecture that is hostile to homeless is the Big Blue Bus stops shown in figure 4. At each bus stop there are divided seats instead of the benches that frequent other city bus stops, the coverage from umbrella like structures is sparse, and the trash cans nearby prevent tampering with solid coverings with a small hole to insert trash. All of these features dissuade homeless from sleeping at the bus stop by making the environment as uncomfortable as possible with little shelter and no place to lay down. The covered trash cans also prevent homeless from rummaging for food to eat or bottles to recycle for cash. The architecture of public transport stops appeals to the majority demographic in addition to the tourists that the city attracts.

Santa Monica’s location and community renovation has established the city as a popular tourist destination which has in turn bolstered its economy. From 2000 to 2004 Santa Monica’s mean beach attendance climbed to 8,832,598 people which represents 6.83% of beach turnout for all of Southern California (Dwight, Brinks, SharavanaKumar, and Semenza). With a multitude of individuals traveling to Santa Monica for its beach, the city has the opportunity to capitalize. However, from the 1970s to the 1980s, the Third Street Mall (now known as the Third Street Promenade) “did not appeal to the new generation” with “old-fashioned,” and “low-end” stores (Pojani). While the beach brought potential customers, the downtown shopping centers did not appeal to beachgoers who were there to enjoy the outdoors. This was a missed opportunity for Santa Monica’s economy and over time the city began to realize it. In 1980s, plans for a new modernized pedestrian mall were put into action and when the construction, planting, lighting, and decoration was complete, the area brought in “five million tourists annually” introducing about “$50 million” into the city’s economy (Pojani). The creation of a modern pedestrian outdoor mall attracted people from all over due to its unique outdoor environment adjacent to the beach. This mall has now increased funding for the community, allowing for more to be spent on sustainability practices and public works. Tourism has created new opportunities, which affects the city atmosphere.

Santa Monica has created the ideal environment for new innovative companies. Walking through downtown, you can see innovative companies all around. The Promenade alone is home to a modern Apple store, a sleek Tesla shop, an incoming hyper reality experience called The Void, and more. Also, if one does not want to walk to get somewhere downtown, Bird scooters are parked all along the sidewalks of Santa Monica. The city draws in companies like Bird whose motto is to “make transportation better & more environmentally friendly” (Bird.co). The environmental sustainability focus in the region is an appealing factor in where companies decide to release their products. In the case of Bird, Santa Monica is a perfect fit because of the city values environmental protection as well as innovative transport systems as can be seen with the Big Blue Bus system and the metro stations. This easy transportation in addition to modern architecture attracts other “high-power” and “high-tech” companies including “Hulu, Universal Music Group and Innovative Artists” (Santa Monica Line). The city’s working atmosphere has gradually become more conducive to new technological and creative work. As more innovative companies move in, the community culture grows to value new and exciting products, creating an even more welcoming atmosphere for groundbreaking business ideas. Innovative businesses are drawn to the area and slowly change the economic characteristics of the community.

The economic evolution in Santa Monica creates an unstable trend towards more leisure time and less work. In economics there is a labor market concept known as the “backward bending” supply of labor. The central idea is that as wages increase, “people might be less inclined to work” because they make enough money to spend on leisure activities (Plott). In Santa Monica this situation already presents itself with the convenience of the beach and the mean and median wage being one third larger than California’s (Census). In an effort to keep the city sustainable, Santa Monica created the Sustainable City Plan, which included a target for economic diversity—no one sector larger than 25% and the top three sectors no larger than 50% of the economy. In 2002 the city was hitting the target with the three largest economic sectors were “professional, science, and technology” at 19%, “information” at 14%, and “health care and social assistance” at 11% (Bertone, Parry, Kubani and Wolch). Although economic diversity might have been achieved in 2002, many of the top three economic sector jobs are high paying and may contribute to people working less than they might in another job. While this is not necessarily bad, it could be if the high paying sectors overwhelm the other economic areas. This is exactly the trend that has occurred since 2002. As of 2016, the three largest economic areas are “professional, scientific, and management, and administrative and waste management services” at 21.3%, “educational services, and health care and social assistance” at 21.2%, and “information” at 12.3% (Census). The top three sectors now total more than 50% of the economy in Santa Monica and the professional, science, and management sector is closing in on the 25% sustainable limit. If this trend continues, the community will have less economic diversity and higher wages overall. This could lead to less economic opportunity due to the decreased range of job types and less economic productivity due to the backwards bending labor supply curve theory. With more leisure time, the community dedicates further effort towards sustainability goals.

Santa Monica as a progressive community focuses on environmental sustainability; the progressive spirit is apparent, even at the first glance of downtown. The construction, Bird scooters, high-tech companies, and Big Blue Bus system all reveal the forward-thinking nature of the city and the people who live there. Industrial and wastewater facilities with runoff to Santa Monica Beach have “improved treatment,” leading to a “several-fold” decline in contaminants since the 1970s. Now, “urban runoff” contributes the majority of wastewater “constituents” to the beach (Bertone, Parry, Kubani, and Wolch). The community has made continuous efforts to reduce waste drained into the ocean. Santa Monica’s location on a Southern California coast sets the city apart from others by making environmental consequences more apparent. Additionally, the city’s relatively wealthy population enables the implementation of expensive solutions to environmental issues. The city formalized its efforts to combat unsustainable practices by establishing the “Task Force on the Environment in 1991 to “advise the city council.” The Task Force on the Environment was the group that first proposed the “Sustainable City Program,” which has focused the community efforts on specific environmental, economic, social indicators of sustainability (Bertone, Parry, Kubani, and Wolch). Santa Monica’s organization and dedication when it comes to the environment shows how the city values not only the present state of natural resources, but also their future as we continue to live on Earth, polluting its water, air and soil with our waste. The Sustainable City Plan examines the past and present failures in in an attempt to correct them for the future. The progressive, forward thinking efforts revealed in the community’s environmental plan, also extends to youth development.

Santa Monica’s ideals, especially the advancement of youth, show through the art in the community. Within the five-block radius of downtown there are three mapped murals and a few unmapped ones. Of the three mapped, two feature the beach and children as the main subject. In figure 5, a mural titled “Beach Bound” depicts a child dressed for the beach looking through binoculars in the direction of the ocean. Although this mural is beach themed, like many murals in the area, the focused view on the beach represents a subtle expression of goal setting. This reflects the ideals of the forward-thinking community as a whole as they value careful planning for the future and encourage their kids to do so as well. Two blocks away from the mural “Beach Bound,” the mural “I Am Love” sits above the entrance to a parking structure shown in figure 6. The left half of the mural shown contains a disproportionate number of children, as does the rest of the mural that is not shown. The overrepresentation of children at the beach stresses that the Santa Monica community values providing opportunities for experimentation, collaboration, and fun to their children. The image on the lower left portrays teamwork as two kids pull a string of seaweed from the ocean and the image on the lower right reveals two children inspecting the shallow water, representing learning and collaboration as important community values. The value of children exhibited through the local art is a significant representation of the many forward-thinking values in the community, another of which is social reform.

Societal issues are a major sector of sustainability that the city addresses. Despite having a fairly wealthy population, Santa Monica’s population includes approximately “2,000 homeless people” residing in the city and about 20% of residents have “annual incomes below the poverty line.” In addition, the south-central area has serious issues involving “gangs, drugs, and crime” (Rogers, Collins-Jarvis, and Schmitz). In 1988, the city set out to correct some of the problems associated with large homeless and low-income populations by implementing the Public Electronic Network (PEN) project. PEN was created to “provide access” to “public information” and “communication technology” especially to the “socioeconomically disadvantaged” (Rogers, Collins-Jarvis, and Schmitz). PEN creates a more informed and interconnected community by granting public access to information and communication systems, thereby promoting civic participation and communication among homeless and low-income residents. This fosters a culture of awareness, knowledge, and open communication in the community. Santa Monica confronts the homeless problem from another angle with “long-term stabilization plans” aiming to help transfer homeless into “permanent housing” and “consistent employment.” As of 2002, 2566 homeless resided in funded shelters and 244 of those had “transitioned to permanent residences” (Bertone, Parry, Kubani, and Wolch). Through homeless aid and other similar programs, the neighborhood reveals its dedication to creating a sustainable and equitable social space by assimilating the homeless into the current culture and lifestyle of the community. Santa Monica plans to create a stable community by helping the socioeconomically disadvantaged climb up in society, which is a very progressive way of thinking. Progressive ideals are embedded in the framework of the community, making societal development a priority.

Santa Monica is a forward-thinking community focused on many aspects of sustainability. The city’s architectural environment reflects the contemporary standards of the community. Business in Santa Monica has grown and specialized as a result of the city values. The values in the community focus on forward thinking, emphasizing the importance of the environment, societal progression towards economic equality, and the development of youth. The modern architecture, innovative industries, and progressive tenets mold the majority middle class white community which in return define those initial factors. This cyclical process is central in all ecosystems both in nature and in modern human communities. Over time the ecosystem changes and evolves, sometimes in an unsustainable trend towards destruction. In the coming generations it will be the task of cities like Santa Monica to prevent deterioration of the environment and society through a precise balance of consumption and creation.
